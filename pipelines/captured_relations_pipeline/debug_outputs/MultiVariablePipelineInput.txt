Childhood Maltreatment May Affect MDDINTRODUCTIONMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatricdisorder ( 1), which usually leads people to suﬀering fromemotional disturbances and cognitive impairments ( 2,3).Working memory (WM) involves the capability to memorize,retrieve, and utilize the information for a limited period ( 4)and is incredibly easily impaired in MDD patients ( 5,6).Numbersofstudiesfoundwidespreadincreasedbrainactivat ionsduring the cognitive process in MDD patients ( 7), includingtheanteriorprefrontalcortex(APFC)( 8),dorsolateralprefrontalcortex (9,10), and cingulate cortex ( 11). However, some studiesshowed hypoactive brain regions, including the frontal cort ex,temporal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) an dparietal cortex in depressed patients ( 12–14). These divergentresults suggested the complexity of this issue, and potentialfactors might be the types of WM ( 15) and the levels ofstress. Besides, childhood maltreatment has been consider ed toaccelerate the development of depression ( 16–18). Moreover, adecreasedvolumeofprefrontalcortexmightplayamediatedro leintherelationshipbetweenchildhoodmaltreatmentanddec linedcognitive functioning ( 19–21). However, how can childhoodmaltreatment aﬀect the WM process is complicated as stresshas both direct neuroendocrine ( 22) and indirect methylation(23) eﬀects on the development of depression. We hypothesizedthat the neural basis of the childhood maltreatment eﬀects atdiﬀerent WM task conditions were diﬀerent. To explore thishypothesis, we designed a WM task ( 24,25) with varyingsubtasks(maintenancevs.manipulation)andvaryingstress levels(non-competition vs. competition) to compare the childhoodmaltreatmenteﬀectsindiﬀerentconditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsIn this study, 53 MDD patients and 64 healthy controls (HCs)were recruited. The patients were outpatients recruited fromPeking University Sixth Hospital. We used the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Te xtRevision(DSM-IV-TR )diagnosticcriteriaofdepressiondisorder,without other comorbidities of the DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders.Two psychiatrists assessed the patients by using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 5.0) ( 26). AllHCs were enrolled by advertising in the community and socialmedia and evaluated by using the Structured Clinical Intervi ewforDSM-IV-TR AxisIDisorders,ResearchVersion,Non-patientEdition to exclude any mental disorder ( 27). The currentstudy was approved by the ethical committee of the PekingUniversitySixthHospital.Alltheparticipantsweregivendeta iledinformation about the purpose and procedures of the study andsignedthewrittenconsents.We used the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) to evaluate the symptom severity ( 28). In addition, weused Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to examine howcould childhood maltreatment aﬀect brain function in adultMDD patients ( 29). Subjects were included using the followingcriteria: (1) between 18 and 55 years of age, (2) right-hande d,(3) Chinese Han lineage, and (4) MDD patients needed toget a HAMD-17 score ≥17. Subjects were excluded with thefollowing criteria: (1) any current or history of neurologic aldisease, (2) a history of more than 5-min loss of consciousnes s,(3) contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanning, (4) electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months orhistory of severe medical illness, (5) other genetic disease ,(6) serious impulsive behavior or suicide attempts, and (7)pregnancyandlactation.We excluded subjects with low image quality or who didnot complete the task (six MDD patients and four HCs)or with an accuracy rate of the maintenance <50% undercompetitive/non-competitive setting (two MDD patients, noHCs) or with head motion of more than 3◦rotation/3-mmtranslation (eight MDD patients and six HCs). Finally, 37MDD subjects and 54 HCs were included in the analysis(Table1). Among the 37 patients, 10 patients were drug-naive.In addition, 17 MDD patients were taking selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (ﬂuoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline) , sixwere taking serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(venlafaxine, duloxetine), two were taking noradrenergic a ndspeciﬁc serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), one wastaking dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, DNRIs(bupropion),andonewastakingﬂupentixolandmelitracen.WM Paradigm and Image AcquisitionWe developed an event-related “number calculation WM”task from previous works ( 30,31) and newly comprisedalternating competitive and non-competitive blocks ( Figure1).We validated that both the diﬀerent subtasks and the diﬀerentstress levels were successfully introduced in this task fro m ourprevious study ( 28), in which the detailed description of thistask could be found. A 3.0-T GE Discovery MR750 scannerwas used for scanning all participants at the Center for MRIResearch, Peking University Institute of Mental Health. TheparametersofthefunctionalMRIareasfollows:eachechoplanarimage included 33 (thickness/gap =4.2/0mm) axial slices,which covered the whole cerebrum and cerebellum (repetitiontime/echo time =2,000/30ms, ﬂip angle =90◦, ﬁeld of view =22.4×22.4 cm2, matrix=64×64).

Thepreprocessing of the data was performed as following steps:(1) slice timing correction, (2) realigning to the ﬁrst volu meand correcting the head motion, (3) spatially normalizing int ostandard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological Institutetemplate) using a fourth-degree B-spline interpolation, and ( 4)using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to spatial smoothing.

MDD patients had an average illness duration of 18.28months,withameanHAMD-17scoreof24.35.WealsoobtainedtheCTQforMDDpatients,andtheresultsarelistedin Table1.In terms of the accuracy rate, we observed a signiﬁcant maineﬀect of stress with a higher accuracy rate under the stress ta sk(F=30.586,p<0.001), whereas, for task diﬀerence, we founda higher accuracy rate under maintenance task ( F=11.598,p<0.001). The interaction eﬀects of task diﬀerence ×stresswas signiﬁcant ( F=10.126,p=0.002;Figure2). However,no group diﬀerences were found between MDD patients andHCs (Table2). As for RT, we observed a signiﬁcant maineﬀect of task diﬀerence, with longer RT in the manipulationcondition ( F=11.473,p=0.001). Meanwhile, we observed asigniﬁcant main eﬀect of task-diﬀerence, with longer RT in themanipulation condition ( F=362.629,p<0.001). There wereno main eﬀects of group, or interaction eﬀect among the threefactors.WM-Related Brain ActivationDuring each of the WM maintenance and manipulationconditions under stress or non-stress setting in both MDDand HC groups, regions in the prefrontal, parietal, temporal,occipital cortices, and striatum were robustly activated, al ongwith well-established deactivation in areas of default modenetworkduringcognitivetask,includingthemedialPFC(MPFC )and posterior cingulate cortex ( p<0.05, whole-brain FWEcorrection; Figure3,SupplementaryTables1,2 ).Group Differences Under WM MaintenanceConditionUnder the WM maintenance condition, the main eﬀect of stressand interaction eﬀect of diagnosis ×stress were not signiﬁcant.However, the main eﬀect of diagnosis was signiﬁcant in the leftfusiform, left postcentral gyrus, middle cingulum, left supe riortemporal gyrus, and left precuneus ( p<0.05 whole-brain FWEcorrection,cluster >50;Table3).Then,wefocusedonthegroupdiﬀerencesunderstresssetting(p<0.05, whole-brain FWE correction, cluster >2;Figure4).MDD patients had reduced activation in the left fusiform ( x=−50,y= −60,z= −14,T=5.60, cluster size =49).

While we found the βestimations of the peakvoxel inAPFCunder stressmanipulationtask( x=32,y=60,z=2) were negatively correlated with CTQ sex abuse ( r= −0.43,p=0.008;Figure4D ). These βestimations were also negativelycorrelated with CTQ physical neglect ( r= −0.37,p=0.026;Figure4D ),butcouldnotwithstandBonferronicorrection.DISCUSSIONMain FindingsInthecurrentpilotstudy,weaimedtoexploretheneuralchang esin MDD patients by investigating brain function associated wi thastress-relatedWMtask.WefoundthatcomparedtoHCs,MDDpatientsshowedcomprehensivelessbrainactivationduringb oththeWMmaintenanceandmanipulationconditions.Particular ly,we found decreased brain activation in the left fusiform und erboth stress and non-stress settings in both WM maintenanceandmanipulationconditions.Notably,theactivationinthe rightSMA showed group diﬀerences in both WM maintenance andmanipulation conditions under non-stress but not stress set ting.We also found a reduced APFC activation in MDD under WMmanipulation task under stress setting, which was negativelycorrelatedwiththeCTQsexabuse.Left Fusiform GyrusOur study found that the activation of the left fusiform gyru swas decreased in MDD patients in both maintenance andmanipulation conditions under non-stress or stress setting .The fusiform gyrus is the most crucial part of the high-level visual cortex, which is associated with the recogniti on offacial expressions ( 32,33), integration of cognitive information,and emotional modulation ( 34). Previous studies had observedreduced gray matter volume, thinner cortical thickness, an d lesssurface area of the fusiform gyrus in patients with depression(35–37). The fusiform gyrus may integrate the emotionaland cognitive processes by modulating the visual stimulatio nprocesses.Moreover,comparedtoHCs,theconnectivitybetweenthefusiformgyrusandmedialorbitofrontalcortexwasdecr easedin MDD patients ( 38), which suggested that the fusiform gyrushad an indirect eﬀect on the WM function and emotionalmodulation.Inaddition,thereducedactivationoffusiform gyrusmay also be related to the impaired function of the attentionbiases of negatively emotional stimuli ( 32,39). We speculatedthatintheWMtask,theroleoftheemotionalstimuliprocessw asimpaired under both stress and non-stress settings or whethe rpatientswithMDDsawthefaceofacompetitorornot.Right Supplementary Motor AreaMeta-analyses showed consistent activation of SMA in the WMtask, which indicated that the SMA included in the widespreadfrontoparietal network was part of the core WM network ( 4,40,41). Besides, the visual attention function of executive func tionis regulated by the SMA, precentral gyrus and ACC corticalnetwork ( 42), which beneﬁts the linking of sensory informationto the learning and execution of movement sequences ( 43).Reduced SMA volumes and impairment in implicit motorsequence learning have been observed in MDD patients ( 44).Meanwhile,Sarkheiletal.( 45)foundthattheSMAwasassociatedwith the psychomotor features (such as motor behavior) ofdepression, and they speculated that the increased functiona lconnectivity between the SMA and other regions might suggestthat recruiting more brain resources was needed for completi ngthe more complicated task in MDD patients. Moreover, MDDpatients were sensitive to stress ( 46). In our study, the decreasedactivation of SMA under non-stress but not stress setting mig htalso support this view. As a negative stimulation, the face of acompetitormightaﬀectthevisualattentionofexecutivefunc tion,which resulted in “they potentially required additional seri almentalprocessingsteps”( 47).Hence,thefunctionoftheSMAinMDD patients might be increased for making compensation inthe WM task under stress, which led to increasing the activat ionoftheSMAandreducingthediﬀerencecomparedtoHCs.Anterior Prefrontal CortexStudies showed that the APFC (Brodmann area 10, BA10) wasinvolved in WM, episodic memory, prospective memory, andthe consideration of multiple relations in the meantime ( 48,49).Compared to children with non-depressed mothers, childrenwith depressed mothers showed decreased activation in theAPFC during the N-back task ( 50), which suggested that theactivation of APFC might be an endophenotype of depression.Besides, the activation of the APFC has been observed inrelativelysimpletasksandwouldincreasewiththediﬃcultyl oadof WM task in healthy subjects ( 51). Moreover, a prior workreported that higher activation in the APFC was related to WMFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574Ma et al. Childhood Maltreatment May Affect MDDFIGURE 4 | Group differences under working memory maintenance and man ipulation subtasks (data were controlling for age, p<0.05, voxel-wise whole-brain FWEcorrected). Main group differences under the working memor y maintenance subtask. (A)The left fusiform gyrus showed decreased activation in MDD p atients underthe maintenance and manipulation conditions in stress and n on-stress settings. (B)The right SMA exhibited reduced activation in MDD patients u nder themaintenance and manipulation conditions only in non-stres s setting. (C)Under stress setting, MDD patients showed less activation i n the right APFC in themanipulation condition. (D)In MDD group, and the βestimations of the right APFC peak voxel under stress manipu lation subtask were negatively correlated with sexabuse (r= −0.43,p=0.008) and physical neglect ( r= −0.37,p=0.026) score in the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.and choice-diﬃculty eﬀects associated with self-control ( 52).Besides, APFC is a brain region that is sensitive to stress ( 53),and subjects with posttrauma stress disorder showed decreas edgray matter volume in APFC compared with control subjects(54). Hence, MDD patients might keep the same cognitivecontrol function with HCs under the non-stress setting, or i nthe maintenance condition in the stress setting. However, f acingbothstressandmanipulationsubtask,whichmeansmorechoic ediﬃculties, the cognitive control function in MDD patients wa sdecreasedcomparedtoHCs.Childhood Sex Abuse and APFC ActivationChildhood maltreatment, symptoms of negative emotionality ,poor friend support, and externalizing problems in childhoodand adolescence are risk factors for early-onset MDD patients(55,56). Besides, childhood maltreatment can cause a series ofphysiological and neurohumoral reactions, including reduc edvolumes in the prefrontal cortex ( 57), and may lead individualsto being susceptible to depression ( 58–60). Previous studiesexhibited that the volumes of ventromedial PFC and rostralprefrontal cortex were reduced in children and adults whosuﬀered from physical and sexual abuse ( 61,62). Furthermore,compared to individuals without childhood maltreatment, th eactivity in the MPFC was decreased in individuals who suﬀeredfrom childhood maltreatment during emotional and neutralmemory encoding and recognition ( 22). Meanwhile, substanceabuse and stress can bring about long-lasting changes bymodulating of gene expression or epigenetic mechanisms in thebrain, and indeed an abnormal pattern of genome-wide DNAmethylation in APFC of subjects with alcohol use disorder ( 63).In our study, childhood sex abuse might disrupt the functionof APFC in direct and indirect ways, such as brain activationand DNA methylation, and then contribute to the developmentofdepression.LIMITATIONSThere are several potential limitations in our study. First, thesample size was not large enough. Therefore, it was only a pilotstudy. In the future, we need to enlarge the sample to testand verify the current ﬁndings. Second, we did not distinguis hthe depression subtypes, which might be the reason why therewas no correlation between the βestimations of peak voxeland the HAMD-17 score.

START PROMPT
Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
Use exactly wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including capitalization choices. 

OUTPUT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS START

Neuroimagi ng studies showeddivergent results of the WM process in MDD patients. Stress co uld affect theoccurrence and development of depression, in which childho od maltreatment playedan important role.Methods: Thirty-seven MDD patients and 54 healthy control subjects w ere enrolledand completed a WM functional magnetic resonance imaging tas k with maintenanceand manipulation conditions under stress and non-stress se ttings. We collecteddemographical and clinical data, using 17-item Hamilton De pression Scale (HAMD-17)and Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) in MDD patients. I n the WM task, weanalyzedthemaindiagnosiseffectandexploredthecorrela tionofimpairedbrainregionsin MDD patients with CTQ and HAMD-17.Results: No group differences were found in the accuracy rate and reac tion timebetween the two groups.

Childhood Maltreatment May Affect MDDINTRODUCTIONMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatricdisorder ( 1), which usually leads people to suﬀering fromemotional disturbances and cognitive impairments ( 2,3).Working memory (WM) involves the capability to memorize,retrieve, and utilize the information for a limited period ( 4)and is incredibly easily impaired in MDD patients ( 5,6).Numbersofstudiesfoundwidespreadincreasedbrainactivat ionsduring the cognitive process in MDD patients ( 7), includingtheanteriorprefrontalcortex(APFC)( 8),dorsolateralprefrontalcortex (9,10), and cingulate cortex ( 11). However, some studiesshowed hypoactive brain regions, including the frontal cort ex,temporal cortex, insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) an dparietal cortex in depressed patients ( 12–14). These divergentresults suggested the complexity of this issue, and potentialfactors might be the types of WM ( 15) and the levels ofstress. Besides, childhood maltreatment has been consider ed toaccelerate the development of depression ( 16–18). Moreover, adecreasedvolumeofprefrontalcortexmightplayamediatedro leintherelationshipbetweenchildhoodmaltreatmentanddec linedcognitive functioning ( 19–21). However, how can childhoodmaltreatment aﬀect the WM process is complicated as stresshas both direct neuroendocrine ( 22) and indirect methylation(23) eﬀects on the development of depression. We hypothesizedthat the neural basis of the childhood maltreatment eﬀects atdiﬀerent WM task conditions were diﬀerent. To explore thishypothesis, we designed a WM task ( 24,25) with varyingsubtasks(maintenancevs.manipulation)andvaryingstress levels(non-competition vs. competition) to compare the childhoodmaltreatmenteﬀectsindiﬀerentconditions.MATERIALS AND METHODSParticipantsIn this study, 53 MDD patients and 64 healthy controls (HCs)were recruited. The patients were outpatients recruited fromPeking University Sixth Hospital. We used the Diagnostic andStatistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Te xtRevision(DSM-IV-TR )diagnosticcriteriaofdepressiondisorder,without other comorbidities of the DSM-IV-TR Axis I disorders.Two psychiatrists assessed the patients by using the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (version 5.0) ( 26). AllHCs were enrolled by advertising in the community and socialmedia and evaluated by using the Structured Clinical Intervi ewforDSM-IV-TR AxisIDisorders,ResearchVersion,Non-patientEdition to exclude any mental disorder ( 27). The currentstudy was approved by the ethical committee of the PekingUniversitySixthHospital.Alltheparticipantsweregivendeta iledinformation about the purpose and procedures of the study andsignedthewrittenconsents.We used the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17) to evaluate the symptom severity ( 28). In addition, weused Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ) to examine howcould childhood maltreatment aﬀect brain function in adultMDD patients ( 29). Subjects were included using the followingcriteria: (1) between 18 and 55 years of age, (2) right-hande d,(3) Chinese Han lineage, and (4) MDD patients needed toget a HAMD-17 score ≥17. Subjects were excluded with thefollowing criteria: (1) any current or history of neurologic aldisease, (2) a history of more than 5-min loss of consciousnes s,(3) contraindications for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)scanning, (4) electroconvulsive therapy within 6 months orhistory of severe medical illness, (5) other genetic disease ,(6) serious impulsive behavior or suicide attempts, and (7)pregnancyandlactation.We excluded subjects with low image quality or who didnot complete the task (six MDD patients and four HCs)or with an accuracy rate of the maintenance <50% undercompetitive/non-competitive setting (two MDD patients, noHCs) or with head motion of more than 3◦rotation/3-mmtranslation (eight MDD patients and six HCs). Finally, 37MDD subjects and 54 HCs were included in the analysis(Table1). Among the 37 patients, 10 patients were drug-naive.In addition, 17 MDD patients were taking selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors (ﬂuoxetine, escitalopram, sertraline) , sixwere taking serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors(venlafaxine, duloxetine), two were taking noradrenergic a ndspeciﬁc serotonergic antidepressants (mirtazapine), one wastaking dopamine norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, DNRIs(bupropion),andonewastakingﬂupentixolandmelitracen.WM Paradigm and Image AcquisitionWe developed an event-related “number calculation WM”task from previous works ( 30,31) and newly comprisedalternating competitive and non-competitive blocks ( Figure1).We validated that both the diﬀerent subtasks and the diﬀerentstress levels were successfully introduced in this task fro m ourprevious study ( 28), in which the detailed description of thistask could be found. A 3.0-T GE Discovery MR750 scannerwas used for scanning all participants at the Center for MRIResearch, Peking University Institute of Mental Health. TheparametersofthefunctionalMRIareasfollows:eachechoplanarimage included 33 (thickness/gap =4.2/0mm) axial slices,which covered the whole cerebrum and cerebellum (repetitiontime/echo time =2,000/30ms, ﬂip angle =90◦, ﬁeld of view =22.4×22.4 cm2, matrix=64×64).

Thepreprocessing of the data was performed as following steps:(1) slice timing correction, (2) realigning to the ﬁrst volu meand correcting the head motion, (3) spatially normalizing int ostandard stereotaxic space (Montreal Neurological Institutetemplate) using a fourth-degree B-spline interpolation, and ( 4)using an 8-mm Gaussian kernel to spatial smoothing.

MDD patients had an average illness duration of 18.28months,withameanHAMD-17scoreof24.35.WealsoobtainedtheCTQforMDDpatients,andtheresultsarelistedin Table1.In terms of the accuracy rate, we observed a signiﬁcant maineﬀect of stress with a higher accuracy rate under the stress ta sk(F=30.586,p<0.001), whereas, for task diﬀerence, we founda higher accuracy rate under maintenance task ( F=11.598,p<0.001). The interaction eﬀects of task diﬀerence ×stresswas signiﬁcant ( F=10.126,p=0.002;Figure2). However,no group diﬀerences were found between MDD patients andHCs (Table2). As for RT, we observed a signiﬁcant maineﬀect of task diﬀerence, with longer RT in the manipulationcondition ( F=11.473,p=0.001). Meanwhile, we observed asigniﬁcant main eﬀect of task-diﬀerence, with longer RT in themanipulation condition ( F=362.629,p<0.001). There wereno main eﬀects of group, or interaction eﬀect among the threefactors.WM-Related Brain ActivationDuring each of the WM maintenance and manipulationconditions under stress or non-stress setting in both MDDand HC groups, regions in the prefrontal, parietal, temporal,occipital cortices, and striatum were robustly activated, al ongwith well-established deactivation in areas of default modenetworkduringcognitivetask,includingthemedialPFC(MPFC )and posterior cingulate cortex ( p<0.05, whole-brain FWEcorrection; Figure3,SupplementaryTables1,2 ).Group Differences Under WM MaintenanceConditionUnder the WM maintenance condition, the main eﬀect of stressand interaction eﬀect of diagnosis ×stress were not signiﬁcant.However, the main eﬀect of diagnosis was signiﬁcant in the leftfusiform, left postcentral gyrus, middle cingulum, left supe riortemporal gyrus, and left precuneus ( p<0.05 whole-brain FWEcorrection,cluster >50;Table3).Then,wefocusedonthegroupdiﬀerencesunderstresssetting(p<0.05, whole-brain FWE correction, cluster >2;Figure4).MDD patients had reduced activation in the left fusiform ( x=−50,y= −60,z= −14,T=5.60, cluster size =49).

Previous studies had observedreduced gray matter volume, thinner cortical thickness, an d lesssurface area of the fusiform gyrus in patients with depression(35–37). The fusiform gyrus may integrate the emotionaland cognitive processes by modulating the visual stimulatio nprocesses.Moreover,comparedtoHCs,theconnectivitybetweenthefusiformgyrusandmedialorbitofrontalcortexwasdecr easedin MDD patients ( 38), which suggested that the fusiform gyrushad an indirect eﬀect on the WM function and emotionalmodulation.Inaddition,thereducedactivationoffusiform gyrusmay also be related to the impaired function of the attentionbiases of negatively emotional stimuli ( 32,39). We speculatedthatintheWMtask,theroleoftheemotionalstimuliprocessw asimpaired under both stress and non-stress settings or whethe rpatientswithMDDsawthefaceofacompetitorornot.Right Supplementary Motor AreaMeta-analyses showed consistent activation of SMA in the WMtask, which indicated that the SMA included in the widespreadfrontoparietal network was part of the core WM network ( 4,40,41). Besides, the visual attention function of executive func tionis regulated by the SMA, precentral gyrus and ACC corticalnetwork ( 42), which beneﬁts the linking of sensory informationto the learning and execution of movement sequences ( 43).Reduced SMA volumes and impairment in implicit motorsequence learning have been observed in MDD patients ( 44).Meanwhile,Sarkheiletal.( 45)foundthattheSMAwasassociatedwith the psychomotor features (such as motor behavior) ofdepression, and they speculated that the increased functiona lconnectivity between the SMA and other regions might suggestthat recruiting more brain resources was needed for completi ngthe more complicated task in MDD patients. Moreover, MDDpatients were sensitive to stress ( 46). In our study, the decreasedactivation of SMA under non-stress but not stress setting mig htalso support this view. As a negative stimulation, the face of acompetitormightaﬀectthevisualattentionofexecutivefunc tion,which resulted in “they potentially required additional seri almentalprocessingsteps”( 47).Hence,thefunctionoftheSMAinMDD patients might be increased for making compensation inthe WM task under stress, which led to increasing the activat ionoftheSMAandreducingthediﬀerencecomparedtoHCs.Anterior Prefrontal CortexStudies showed that the APFC (Brodmann area 10, BA10) wasinvolved in WM, episodic memory, prospective memory, andthe consideration of multiple relations in the meantime ( 48,49).Compared to children with non-depressed mothers, childrenwith depressed mothers showed decreased activation in theAPFC during the N-back task ( 50), which suggested that theactivation of APFC might be an endophenotype of depression.Besides, the activation of the APFC has been observed inrelativelysimpletasksandwouldincreasewiththediﬃcultyl oadof WM task in healthy subjects ( 51). Moreover, a prior workreported that higher activation in the APFC was related to WMFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574Ma et al. Childhood Maltreatment May Affect MDDFIGURE 4 | Group differences under working memory maintenance and man ipulation subtasks (data were controlling for age, p<0.05, voxel-wise whole-brain FWEcorrected). Main group differences under the working memor y maintenance subtask. (A)The left fusiform gyrus showed decreased activation in MDD p atients underthe maintenance and manipulation conditions in stress and n on-stress settings. (B)The right SMA exhibited reduced activation in MDD patients u nder themaintenance and manipulation conditions only in non-stres s setting. (C)Under stress setting, MDD patients showed less activation i n the right APFC in themanipulation condition. (D)In MDD group, and the βestimations of the right APFC peak voxel under stress manipu lation subtask were negatively correlated with sexabuse (r= −0.43,p=0.008) and physical neglect ( r= −0.37,p=0.026) score in the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire.and choice-diﬃculty eﬀects associated with self-control ( 52).Besides, APFC is a brain region that is sensitive to stress ( 53),and subjects with posttrauma stress disorder showed decreas edgray matter volume in APFC compared with control subjects(54). Hence, MDD patients might keep the same cognitivecontrol function with HCs under the non-stress setting, or i nthe maintenance condition in the stress setting. However, f acingbothstressandmanipulationsubtask,whichmeansmorechoic ediﬃculties, the cognitive control function in MDD patients wa sdecreasedcomparedtoHCs.Childhood Sex Abuse and APFC ActivationChildhood maltreatment, symptoms of negative emotionality ,poor friend support, and externalizing problems in childhoodand adolescence are risk factors for early-onset MDD patients(55,56). Besides, childhood maltreatment can cause a series ofphysiological and neurohumoral reactions, including reduc edvolumes in the prefrontal cortex ( 57), and may lead individualsto being susceptible to depression ( 58–60). Previous studiesexhibited that the volumes of ventromedial PFC and rostralprefrontal cortex were reduced in children and adults whosuﬀered from physical and sexual abuse ( 61,62). Furthermore,compared to individuals without childhood maltreatment, th eactivity in the MPFC was decreased in individuals who suﬀeredfrom childhood maltreatment during emotional and neutralmemory encoding and recognition ( 22). Meanwhile, substanceabuse and stress can bring about long-lasting changes bymodulating of gene expression or epigenetic mechanisms in thebrain, and indeed an abnormal pattern of genome-wide DNAmethylation in APFC of subjects with alcohol use disorder ( 63).In our study, childhood sex abuse might disrupt the functionof APFC in direct and indirect ways, such as brain activationand DNA methylation, and then contribute to the developmentofdepression.LIMITATIONSThere are several potential limitations in our study. First, thesample size was not large enough. Therefore, it was only a pilotstudy. In the future, we need to enlarge the sample to testand verify the current ﬁndings. Second, we did not distinguis hthe depression subtypes, which might be the reason why therewas no correlation between the βestimations of peak voxeland the HAMD-17 score. Therefore, we need to investigatethe diﬀerences among diﬀerent subtypes of depression andstudy the relationship between clinical symptoms and underli nemechanisminalargersample.CONCLUSIONIn our pilot study, the decreased brain activation of the leftfusiform gyrus, SMA, and APFC helps us to understand theabnormalities of the emotional stimuli processing function ,Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2021 | Volume 12 | Article 671574Ma et al.

Early Mal adaptive Schemas: A Comparison BetweenBipolar Disorder and Major Depressive DisorderKristine Kahr Nilsson,1*Krista Nielsen Straarup2and Marianne Halvorsen3,41Center for Developmental and Applied Psychological Science (CeDAPS), the Department of Communicationand Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark2Mood Disorders Clinic, Aarhus University Hospital, Risskov, Denmark3Department of Psychology, University of Tromsø, Faculty of Health Science, Norway4Department of Pediatric Rehabilitation, University Hospital of North Norway, NorwayBackground: It is still unclear how bipolar disorder (BD) differentiates from major depressive disorder(MDD) outside major mood episodes. To further elucidate this area, the present study compared the twomood disorders in terms of early maladaptive schemas (EMSs) during remission.Method: The sample consisted of 49 participants with BD and 30 participants with MDD who werecurrently in remission. The participants completed the Young Schema Questionnaire.Results: The BD group scored signi ﬁcantly higher than the MDD group o n seven EMSs: abandonment,failure to achieve, insuf ﬁcient self-control, subjugation, unrelentin g standards, enmeshment and entitlement.Conclusion: By suggesting that EMSs are more severe in BD compared with MDD, the ﬁndings high-light potential vulnerabilities in BD, which merit further examination in terms of their underlyingcauses and potential treatment implications. Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.Key Practitioner Message:Early maladaptive schemas are relevant psychological dimensions to consider in remitted phases of ma-jor mood disorders.Findings from the current study suggest that early maladaptive schemas are more prevalent in adults withbipolar disorder compared to adults with major depressive disorder when measured during remission.Interventions targeting early maladaptive schemas may be valuable in treatment of bipolar disorder.Keywords: Bipolar Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder, Remission, Early Maladaptive SchemasINTRODUCTIONSince the earliest nosological proposals within modernpsychiatry (Krapelin, 1921; Leonhard, 1957), it has beenwidely debated whether unipolar and bipolar mooddisorders represent distinct disease entities or differentsubtypes within a mood disorder spectrum. A vast amountof research point to essential differences between the twomood disorders, now termed bipolar disorder (BD) andmajor depressive disorder (MDD), including different agesof onset, depressive symptomatology and medicationresponses (Goodwin & Jameson, 2007). However, evidencepointing to genetic co-heritability between the two disor-ders (Kendler et al., 2013) and one-third of MDD patientsconverting into BD patients (Dudek et al., 2013) indicatenebulous boundaries and an area in need of furtherelucidation.A hallmark of mood disorders is abnormal self-evaluationas manifested by in ﬂated and de ﬂated perceptions of selfduring mania and depression, respectively. Abnormalitiesin self-evaluation are, however, not con ﬁned to moodepisodes but also manifest during remitted illness phasesof MDD and BD as evinced by lower self-esteem (Nilssonet al., 2010b) and higher self-compartmentalization (Alatiq,Crane, Williams, & Goodwin, 2010; Taylor, Morley, & Bar-ton, 2007). Yet, little is known about the speci ﬁct h e m e sand patterns of self-conception in mood disorders duringremission. The schema theory developed by Young, Kloskoand Weishaar (2003), which contains an operationalizedmodel of self-conceptual themes associated with psychopa-thology and dysfunction, provides a heuristic frameworkfor examining differences between MDD and BD in thisdomain. The key concept within this theory is the earlymaladaptive schema (EMS) de ﬁned as a broad, pervasivetheme or pattern comprised of memories, emotions, cognitionsand bodily sensations regarding oneself and one ’s relationship withothers developed during childhood or adolescence elaboratedthroughout one ’s lifetime and dysfunctional to a signi ﬁcant degree(Young et al., 2003, p. 7). In cognitive models of psychopa-thology, schemas are considered the deepest level of*Correspondence to: Kristine Kahr Nilsson, Center for Developmentaland Applied Psychological Science (CeDAPS), the Department ofCommunication and Psychology, Aalborg University, Denmark.E-mail: kkn@hum.aau.dkClinical Psychology and PsychotherapyClin.

DOI: 10.1002/cpp.1896Copyright © 2014 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.cognition, which consists of t emplates for information pro-cessing that guide thinking and behaviours (Wright, 2006).EMSs refer to schemas with early developmental originswhich are highly self-perpetuating and maladaptive hencecausing considerable distress and dysfunction.In earlier cognitive theories of mood disorders, negativeself-schemas were conceptualized as latent cognitive struc-tures which needed to be primed by mood or triggered byparticular life events in order to be activated (Ingram,Miranda, & Segal, 1998; Kovacs & Beck, 1978). In theschema theory, on the other hand, EMSs are conceptualizedas pervasive, ego-syntonic and highly accessible (Rafaeli,Bernstein, & Young, 2011; Young et al., 2003) and thereforedo not require stress-activation or priming in order to beaccessed and measured. Due to these characteristics,EMSs appear relevant to consider as persistent patternsinﬂuencing the remitted illness phases of BD and MDD.Thus far, research into EMSs in mood disorders islimited. The few studies on the topic indicate that EMSsoverall are more severe in mood disorder patientscompared with controls (Ak et al., 2012; Halvorsen, Wang,Eisemann, & Waterloo, 2010; Hawke & Provencher, 2012;Nilsson et al., 2010a). In the only study comparing BDand MDD in terms of EMSs, Hawke and Provencher(2012) found that, compared with MDD patients, BDpatients had signi ﬁcantly higher scores on two EMSs:entitlement and approval seeking. This study points EMSdifferences between the two mood disorders. However,since remission was not an inclusion criterion, the ﬁndingsdo not extrapolate to remitted illness phases of the twomood disorders. Since mood symptoms can in ﬂuencemeasurement, it is important to account for the effects ofmood such as by using a remission design in which remissionis an inclusion criterion. Thus, to elucidate this topic, thepresent study employed a remission design that comparedBD and MDD in terms of EMSs during remission.METHODSSampleThe sample consisted of two mood disorder cohorts whichhave been used for other research purposes in previouslypublished studies (Halvorsen et al., 2009; Halvorsen et al.,2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al., 2010a). The inclusioncriteria were a diagnosis of either MDD or BD and currentremission de ﬁned as the absence of major affective episodesestablished by clinical interviews. The procedures and mea-sures are described in earlier publications (Halvorsen et al.,2009; Halvorsen et al., 2010; Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al.,2010a). The participants with MDD were furthermorerequired to have at least two past depressive episodesin order to match the minimum number of affectiveepisodes required for a diagnosis of BD according tothe diagnostic criteria of ICD-10 (WHO, 1993).The data were collected in two sites in Scandinavia: TheUniversity Clinic at the University of Tromsø, Norway,Table 1.

The merged sample consisted of 30participants with MDD and 49 participants with BD.MeasureThe short version of the Young Schema Questionnaire(YSQ-S2; Young, 1998) was used to measure 15 differentEMSs outlined in Table 1. The YSQ-S2 is a self-reportquestionnaire which requests the respondents to rate 75statements on a Likert Scale ranging from 1 = ‘completelyuntrue of me ’to 6 = ‘describes me perfectly ’. The psycho-metric properties of the YSQ-S2 have been supported inprior research in terms of internal consistency, factor struc-ture and convergent validity (e.g., Calvete, Estévez, Lópezde Arroyabe, & Ruiz, 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Welburnet al., 2002). The schema domains, which describe catego-ries of EMSs de ﬁned by their developmental origins(Young et al., 2003), were not analysed as higher orderdimensions due to inconsistent support of their factorialvalidity (Calvete et al., 2005; Hoffart et al., 2005; Leventeet al., 2012).Data AnalysisStatistical analyses were performed using the StatisticalPackage for the Social Sciences —Version 19.0 (SPSS, Inc.,Chicago, USA). To examine between-group differences,t-tests were used for continuous variables and chi-squareanalyses for categorical variables. Estimates of thesubscales ’internal consistencies were assessed throughCronbach ’s alpha coef ﬁcients.RESULTSDescriptive and inferential statistics are presented inTable 2. The percentage of women was signi ﬁcantly higherin the MDD group compared with the BD group. However,the only EMS in which a sex difference emerged was entitle-ment with men scoring signi ﬁcantly higher than women(t=2 . 8 7 , p= 0.005). The use of psychopharmacologicaltreatments was signi ﬁcantly more prevalent in the BDgroup compared with the MDD group. Within the MDDgroup, there were no signi ﬁcant differences in EMS scoresbetween participants who received psychopharmacologicaltreatments and participants who did not. Similar compari-sons could not be made within the BD group since onlyone participant was not on medication. There was no signif-icant age difference between the BD group and the MDDgroup. The Cronbach ’s alpha coef ﬁcients indicated thatmost of the EMS subscales had adequate internal consisten-cies (Table 3). However, vulnerability to harm and illnessand enmeshment had coef ﬁcients slightly below 0.70 andshould therefore be interpreted with caution. The t-tests(Table 3) revealed that the BD group scored signi ﬁcantlyhigher than the MDD group on seven EMSs: abandonment,failure to achieve, and insuf ﬁcient self-control, subjugation,unrelenting standards, enmeshment and entitlement. Thedifferences on entitlement remained signi ﬁcant when con-trolling for the identi ﬁed sex difference ( t=4 . 4 5 , p=0 . 0 0 0 ) .An additional three EMSs were elevated in BD comparedwith MDD at a near-signi ﬁcant level: mistrust, social isola-tion and dependence (Table 3).Table 2.

See the Terms and Conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on Wiley Online Library for rules of use; OA articles are governed by the applicable Creative Commons LicenseDISCUSSIONThe present study compared EMSs between BD and MDDduring remission. The results revealed that the BD groupscored higher than the MDD group on most of the EMSscales, and for seven EMSs, the differences were statisticallysigniﬁcant: abandonment, failure to achieve, insuf ﬁcientself-control, subjugation, unrelenting standards, enmesh-ment and entitlement. These ﬁndings extends previousﬁndings by Hawke and Provencher (2012) by suggestingthat EMSs also tend to be more severe in BD compared withMDD during remission.Theﬁndings may be interpreted through a schematheory lens. According to Young et al. (2003), temperamentaldispositions interact with need-thwarting or traumatic earlylife experiences in the formation of EMSs. Studies suggestthat BD, compared with MDD, is associated with morechildhood traumas (Hyun, Friedman, & Dunner, 2000) andtemperamental dysregulation (Matsumoto et al ., 2005;Nowakowska et al., 2005; Savitz, van der Merwe, &Ramesar, 2008). Thus, a higher prevalence of the pro-posed origins of EMSs in BD may explain the greaterEMS severity in this disorder compared with MDD.Moreover, since EMSs purportedly continue their forma-tions in adulthood (Young et al., 2003), the illness courseof mood disorder may be assumed to play a role in theirformation. Compared with MDD, BD is characterizedby more frequent depres sive episodes (Forty et al., 2008),more comorbid anxiety disorders and personality disor-ders (Moreno et al., 2012) and an earlier illness onset(Tondo, Lepri, Cruz, & Baldessarini, 2010; Weissmanet al., 1996). A more pervasive illness course in BD maybe conceived as having detrimental effects that contributeto the higher EMS severity in this group compared withMDD.Theﬁndings may be considered in terms of their clinicalimplications. Schema therapy (ST; Young et al., 2003), apsychotherapeutic treatment which speci ﬁcally targetsEMSs, has been found to have comparable ef ﬁcacy withcognitive behaviour therapy in the treatment of MDD(Carter et al., 2013). Considering the higher EMS severityin BD compared with MDD, as indicated by the presentstudy, it is pertinent to contemplate whether ST wouldhave additional treatment effects if applied to BD. Hawke,Provenche, and Parikhb (2013) have proposed a modi ﬁedversion of ST for BD which emphasizes mood stabilizationand prevention of affective relapses and recurrences. Thus,the effects of ST tailored the symptomatology of BD seemrelevant to investigate in future treatments studies.A number of methodological drawbacks need to be con-sidered when interpreting the ﬁndings. First, as describedelsewhere (Halvorsen et al., 2009; Halvorsen et al., 2010;Nilsson, 2012; Nilsson et al., 2010a), the assessment proce-dures used at two data-collection sites differed with regardto speci ﬁc symptom measures and initial recruitmentstrategies. The present ﬁndings should therefore be consid-ered provisional and in need of further replication. Second,due to the cross-sectional design, the present study did notprovide any insights into causal mechanisms underlyingEMSs in the two mood disorders. The development ofEMSs in mood disorders therefore remains to be eluci-dated by longitudinal research.In conclusion, by suggesting that EMSs overall are moresevere in BD compared with MDD during remission, theﬁndings elaborate the understanding of differences be-tween the two mood disorders. Moreover, the ﬁndingshighlight potential vulnerabilities in BD, which meritfurther investigation in terms of their underlying causesand potential treatment implications.CONFLICT OF INTERESTThe authors do not have any commercial associationwhich might pose a con ﬂict of interest in connection withthe manuscript.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTThis study was partially made possible through fundinggranted to the ﬁrst author from Aarhus University, Denmark.A n o t h e rp a r to ft h i ss t u d yw a ss u p p o r t e db yt h eN a t i o n a lProgram of Integrated Clinical Specialists and PhD trainingfor Psychologist in Norway and the Psychiatric ResearchCentre of Northern Norway.

Conclu-sions:   The current study is the first to systematically investi-gate the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD, exploring a broad range of cognitive domains. The re-sults partially support the hypothesis that rumination has an impact on single cognitive domains and highlight the neces-sity for further investigations in order to generalize these findings.  © 2017 S. Karger AG, Basel  Introduction  Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with a wide range of affective and somatic symptoms as well as cognitive impairments in the acute state  [1–4]   and may be long lasting despite symptom reduction and recovery  [5, 6]  . Rumination is often discussed as an important po-tential underlying cognitive mechanisms in the context of cognitive impairments in MDD. Rumination is a style of thinking characterized by repetitive, recurrent, intrusive, and uncontrollable thoughts  [7] . These persistent nega-tive thoughts are a hallmark feature of MDD. People who ruminate repetitively contemplate reasons for and conse-quences of their sadness  [8] . Although ruminators believe  Keywords  Rumination · Major depression · Cognitive impairments · Cognitive dysfunctions · Processing speed · Attention · Memory · Executive functions  Abstract   Background:   Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with impairments in several cognitive domains. People with depression also tend to focus on and think about their prob-lems (“ruminate”) more than people without depression. Re-cent studies indicate that depressive rumination is connect-ed to cognitive impairments in MDD. However, there is little scientific understanding of the role of rumination in these deficits.  Sampling and Methods:   The current study exam-ined the performance of 62 outpatients suffering from uni-polar major depression with a low tendency to ruminate ver-sus outpatients with a high tendency to ruminate using a neuropsychological battery covering the 5 cognitive do-mains: attention, memory, working memory, executive func-tions and processing speed.  Results:   The results indicated that high ruminators show a lower performance than low ruminators with regard to processing speed and executive function tasks with low effect sizes. However, these findings were not significant after Bonferroni correction.

Moreover, rumination has been identified as a core risk factor for depression with serious clinical im-plications due to more depressed mood, longer depres-sive episodes and the occurrence of future depressive ep-isodes  [7–10]  . Recent studies indicate that depressive ru-mination is connected to cognitive impairments in MDD. It is discussed as an important underlying cognitive mechanism. However, there is little understanding of the extent to which rumination influences cognitive perfor-mance, especially in single domains.  Rumination and Cognitive Impairments   Resource allocation theory posits that rumination ab-sorbs cognitive capacities which can thus not be directed towards task-relevant processes  [11–13]  . According to this theory, valuable cognitive resources are allocated to irrelevant depressive and ruminative thought processes. Indeed, there are many findings that support the link be-tween reduced cognitive performance and rumination as put forward in the dual-process model of cognitive vul-nerability in depressed persons. According to this model, the ability of depressed individuals to implement correc-tive reflective processing in order to overcome automatic negative biases is impaired, because this processing re-quires effort and cognitive resources that are not available  [14] . Thus, rumination might reduce  cognitive flexibility   and raise interference levels above a critical threshold. In line with these results, Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema  [15]  showed that participants who scored high on a self-report measure of ruminative style made more perseverative er-rors than nonruminators in the Wisconsin card sorting test, a widely used measure of  executive control   and  cogni-tive flexibility  .  In addition, the dual-process model posits that the cognitive resources of depressed individuals might al-ready be strained by competing mood-congruent and ru-minative thought processes  [14] . In particular the brood-ing, maladaptive component of rumination has been found to be associated with higher negative  attentional biases    [16] , suggesting that depressed individuals with high levels of brooding have tightly connected negative schemata from which they have difficulty in breaking away. Some scholars, on the other hand, have related ru-mination to major deficits in  cognitive control  , regardless of the valence of the processed material. Specifically, ru-minators are thought to exhibit an impaired ability to flexibly shift  attention   or  inhibit  irrelevant information [e.g.  15 ,  17 ].  Previous research has also reported that rumination is related to  memory deficits   and  memory biases   [18, 19]  . For example, when people are asked to recall memories of specific autobiographical events, depressed patients are more likely to retrieve overgeneral, categorical memories that are summaries of repeated occasions than controls [for a review, see  20 ]. Watkins et al.  [21]  found that the distraction induction (as a composite of rumination in-duction) significantly reduced overgeneral memory at preinduction levels.   Rumination has also been associated with  working memory   deficits. Joormann and Gotlib  [22]  proved a link between rumination, impaired  working memory,   and de-pression. They found that the interference of negative ir-relevant words was correlated with self-reported rumina-tion. This relation with rumination was limited to the MDD group and remained significant even after partial-ing out the level of depressive symptomatology: the high-er the participants’ scored for the self-reported measure of rumination, the greater their difficulty in removing task-irrelevant negative content from their working memory. The connection between rumination and im-paired working memory was also reported by other au-thors  [23, 24]  .  There have also been several experimental research studies on the effect of induced rumination on  executive functions   [e.g.  25–27  ]. In the study by Watkins and Brown  [13] , for example, the performance of depressed patients and nondepressed controls was compared for a random number generation task, performed after either a rumina-tion or a distraction induction. Compared with the dis-traction induction, the rumination induction produced a significant increase in stereotyped counting responses (reflecting a failure of inhibitory executive control) in de-pressed patients but not in controls. However, after dis-traction, no difference was found between the 2 groups. The authors concluded that the rumination induction may interfere with concurrent executive processing.  In sum, findings from the studies reviewed above ten-tatively support a connection between rumination and deficits in cognitive performance. However, previous re-search on the impact of rumination on cognitive impair-ments in MDD has a number of shortcomings and has left open questions of which 3 seem especially important:   Previous studies reported the influence of ruminative thinking on memory, attention, or executive functions. However, most studies have assessed only 1 or very few aspects of the specific domains such as attentional inflex-ibility, cognitive control, cognitive inflexibility, or task switching. So far there have been no studies that system-Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Cognitive Impairments in Unipolar Depression Psychopathology 2017;50:347–354DOI: 10.1159/000478785349atically examine all cognitive domains. Therefore, gen-eral knowledge on the impact of rumination on different cognitive domains in MDD is still very limited.  Furthermore, many studies on rumination and cogni-tive dysfunctions have not controlled for the influence of other factors such as the severity of depression, the amount of depressive episodes in the past, medication or duration of the current episode. Previous research has shown that these factors can strongly influence the extent of cognitive deficits in MDD  [28] . Moreover, it seems es-sential to control for general factors such as age, patients’ intelligence, or level of education  [29] . However, these factors have not been taken into consideration so far.   Previous investigations have also failed to explore the relationship between rumination in everyday life and cognitive performance. Most studies have assessed the in-fluence of rumination in an experimental design, which required participants to complete several cognitive tasks after introducing rumination. Therefore, it stands to rea-son that rumination induced shortly before examination has an impact on the ability to solve cognitive tasks. How-ever, it is unclear as to whether depressive patients who ruminate a lot about themselves and their diseases in ev-eryday life also exhibit higher cognitive impairments than depressive patients whose tendency to ruminate in every-day life is not as pronounced.  The current study aims at answering the above-men-tioned questions, thus closing a gap in research by sys-tematically analyzing the relationship between assessed everyday-life rumination and different cognitive func-tions in MDD by controlling for as many influencing fac-tors as possible. Based on previous research, we hypoth-esize that the severity of cognitive deficits in MDD is re-lated to ruminative thinking.  Methods  Participants  The sample consisted of 62 outpatients (age 18–66 years, mean = 43.32, SD = 12.93, 46 female) currently diagnosed with MDD. All participants fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode of the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders   (4th ed., text rev., DSM-IV-TR  [30] ) on the basis of the Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-IV (SCID-I  [31] ). They were recruited for the study from a university teaching outpatient clinic. Thirteen participants were diagnosed with comorbidity in addition to MDD: dysthymia (10 participants), bulimia nervosa (2 participants), and undifferentiated somatoform disorder (1 par-ticipant). Participants with comorbid anxiety disorder, posttrau-matic stress disorder, substance dependence, a history of head in-jury, neurological disease, opioid or antipsychotic medication were excluded. The clinical sample was divided into 2 groups: low ruminators and high ruminators based on their scores on the Re-sponse Style Questionnaire, German version (RSQ-D)  [32] , with a sum score of 40 and above indicating high rumination. Thirty-six participants (22% of low ruminators and 38% of high ruminators) were taking antidepressants. Twenty-two participants were taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, 5 selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, 11 noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressants, 5 tricyclic antidepressants, and 1 was taking monoamine oxidase inhibitors.  Measures  Hamilton Depression Rating Scale  The 17-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD)  [33]  was used. The HAMD is the most commonly used clinical scale to assess the severity of depression in clinical practice and research  [34] .  Response Styles Questionnaire, German Version  The RSQ  [32]  is a self-report instrument that assesses the ten-dency to respond to negative emotions with ruminative thoughts. Participants respond to items on a 4-point scale anchored by “al-most never” and “almost always.” The authors report high test-retest reliability and internal consistency for the RSQ-D.  Neuropsychological Assessment  The neuropsychological tests were taken from the COGBAT test battery of the Vienna test system  [35] . The test set measures subdimensions in the areas of attention, memory, verbal working memory, executive functions, and processing speed and has been validated across neurological and psychiatric populations.  Procedure  All participants were recruited from the outpatient psychother-apy clinic of the University of Landau, Germany, where they asked for psychotherapy. As it is usual routine of the outpatient clinic, potential patients were invited for a first screening interview. If depressive symptoms were identified and were of major concern to the patients, they were informed of the study. If they agreed to participate, informed consent was obtained.   The assessment was divided into two 1-h sessions. In the first session, trained interviewers administered the structured clinical Interview for the DSM-IV  [36]  to participants to ensure that they fully met the criteria for a current unipolar MDD episode. After-wards participants were interviewed regarding further criteria for being included in or excluded from the study and were rated on the HAMD  [33] . In a next step, they completed the RSQ-D  [32] . A few days after the first session, participants came to our laboratory to complete the cognitive tasks with the neuropsychological test battery COGBAT. All participants were tested individually after having completed the informed consent form. The research was approved by the Local Research Ethics Committees.  Statistical Analysis  All statistical comparisons were performed using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 21). The neuropsychological test scores were transformed into stan-dardized ( z ) scores and polarized in 1 direction (with higher scores indicating a better performance). Performance was calculated sep-arately for the 5 cognitive domains of information-processing speed, attention, verbal working memory, memory, and executive Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Schwert/Aschenbrenner/Weisbrod/Schröder Psychopathology 2017;50:347–354DOI: 10.1159/000478785350function by combining the test scores, shown in  Table 1 , in accor-dance with the published recommendations (Wiener Test-System, 2012, Mödling, Schuhfried GmbH). These scores demonstrated an acceptable internal consistency ranging from α = 0.63 (attention) to α = 0.95 (memory).  In the preliminary analyses  t  tests were conducted to compare the group of depressive patients ( n = 62  ) with the normative data of COGBAT ( n  = 62) matched on gender, age, and education level on cognitive performance. Further  t  tests were conducted to com-pare the differences between low- and high-rumination groups on the same cognitive domains. The relation between rumination and distinct domains of cognitive performance was examined through a series of hierarchical regression analyses. In each analysis the general factors age, years of education and gender were entered into the model in step 1. In step 2, depression-related variables – number of depressive episodes in the past, severity of depression (score on the HAMD), intake of medication and duration of the current episode – were included into the model. Finally, in step 3, the rumination score was added to the model.  Results  The descriptive statistics for the main study variables, separated according to the level of rumination (low vs. high) are presented in  Table 2 . There were no significant differences in age, years of education, amount of past de-pressive episodes, and duration of current depressive ep-isode as well as HAMD score between the groups. The 2 groups only differed significantly on the RSQ-D score.   The results of the  t  tests comparing the differences be-tween depressive patients and normative data indicate a worse performance of the patients in processing speed tasks ( t (60) = 2.59;  p  < 0.05; Cohen’s  d  = 0.47), attention tasks ( t (60)  =  4.69;  p  < 0.001; Cohen’s  d  = 0.84), memory tasks ( t (59)  =  3.84;  p  < 0.001; Cohen’s  d  = 0.69), verbal working memory tasks ( t (60)  =  1.61; ns; Cohen’s  d  = 0.29), and executive function tasks ( t (60)  =  2.64;  p  < 0.01; Cohen’s  d  = 0.47). The results of the  t  tests relating to the different rumination groups are presented in  Table 3 . The findings indicate that high ruminators perform worse than low ru-minators in processing speed tasks ( t (59)  =  1.70;  p  < 0.05; Cohen’s  d  = 0.41) and executive function tasks ( t (60)  =  1.82;  p  < 0.05; Cohen’s  d  = 0.48) with low effect sizes. How-ever, the results become nonsignificant after Bonferroni-Holm α-level adjustment (α fam  = 0.05,  s =  5 comparisons). Table 1.

The addition of the rumination score in step 3 only produced a significant in-crement in  R  2  for the processing speed tasks (β = –0.22; Δ R  2  = 0.05;  p  < 0.05). For the executive function tasks, adding rumination led to a nonsignificant increment (β = –0.19; Δ R  2  = 0.03;  p  > 0.05). Rumination did not ex-plain cognitive performance in attention, verbal working memory, and memory either. Moreover, age was found to be a significant predictor of worse cognitive performance on processing speed (β  =  –0.60;  p  < 0.001), attention (β  =  –0.53;  p  < 0.001), and memory (β  =  –0.64;  p  < 0.001). At-tention was significantly predicted by duration of current depressive episode (poorer attention in case of prolonged episode) (β = –0.29;  p  < 0.05) as well as by years of educa-tion (higher attention in case of more years of education) (β = 0.30;  p  < 0.01). The HAMD score significantly pre-dicted the memory (β  =  –0.25;  p  < 0.05) of MDD patients.  Discussion  The aim of the current study was to determine wheth-er there is a connection between everyday-life rumination and cognitive impairments in attention, verbal working memory, memory, executive functions, and processing speed, respectively, in MDD patients. The results indicate that everyday rumination is associated with increased cognitive impairments with regard to information-pro-cessing speed in MDD. Moreover, high-ruminating de-pressive persons tend to exhibit impaired executive func-tions compared to low-ruminating persons. However, the impact of rumination on executive functions disappears after a hierarchical regression analysis. Beyond that, there is no association of rumination with impairments in the domains of attention, working memory as well as mem-ory. These results imply that rumination in everyday life does not necessarily lead to problems in cognition in gen-eral. Furthermore, we identified age, the duration of the  Table 4.

Our results indicate that cognitive impairments in MDD are linked to rumination in the domain of process-ing speed. This was the only cognitive domain that was influenced by rumination after including other predic-tors in the hierarchical regression analysis. To our knowl-edge, there has been no previous research on the impact of rumination on processing speed. This is, however, a basic cognitive domain which affects cognitive perfor-mance in general. In line with these results, previous stud-ies have suggested that cognitive impairments in depres-sion may be mediated in part or wholly by more basic deficits such as processing speed [e.g.  37–39  ]. These stud-ies did not, however, examine the influence of rumination in this context. It seems that rumination could be an un-derlying mechanism for the connection between process-ing speed and cognitive impairments in MDD. Further research is needed to assess this relationship and to gen-eralize the findings if possible.  Furthermore, our findings are partially consistent with the results of Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema  [15] , who ex-amined the influence of self-reported rumination on ex-ecutive functions, especially on executive control and cognitive flexibility. In their study, high ruminators made more preservative errors than nonruminators. In line with this finding high-ruminating MDD patients of the current study reached a lower score in the executive do-main (indicating greater deficits) than low ruminators. The decreasing influence of rumination on the executive domain score in further calculations may be due to the fact that the range between high and low rumination in the current study is smaller than between the high and nonruminators in Davis and Nolen-Hoeksema’s  [15]  in-vestigation.  In contrast to previous reports from experimental studies, which showed an association between rumina-tion and attentional deficits [e.g.  16 ,  22 ], we found no significant difference between the 2 rumination groups in our analysis. Furthermore, our study does not support the existence of a link between rumination and memory def-icits as well as working memory deficits found by other researchers [e.g.  23 ,  24 ]. In this context the findings of Teasdale et al.  [40]  and Antrobus  [41]  have to be taken into consideration. They observed that increasing the cognitive demands of the current external task led to a reduction in the frequency of off-task thoughts, resulting in an improvement in task performance. These results suggest that attention-demanding tasks may disrupt ru-mination. In the current study, we observed rumination in the everyday life of patients, with no rumination induc-tion. For this reason, one could argue that a 1-h neuro-psychological examination already constitutes an in-creased cognitive demand, which interrupts rumination. In this brief period of time, participants of our study may exhibit a relative improvement in their cognitive perfor-mance compared to their performance in everyday life.  Another important point should be taken into consid-eration when interpreting the results concerning the in-fluence of rumination on memory. Based on evidence from “choking under pressure”  [42, 43]  , it is plausible to assume that rumination as a predominantly verbal phe-nomenon mainly absorbs verbal capacities. Using a vi-sual but not a verbal memory test may cause less interfer-ence with rumination and therefore mask possible rela-tionships between rumination and memory. This fact may Iimit the interpretations to a nonsignificant relation-ship between rumination and visual memory, although there is a nonsignificant relationship between rumination and verbal working memory.  To our knowledge, the present investigation is the first that has attempted to systematically determine the impact of rumination on cognitive impairments in MDD in a broad range of cognitive domains. A differentiated stan-dardization was available for each domain. Another im-portant difference between the current study and the ma-jority of previous studies is the absence of induced rumi-nation. Typically, participants are induced to ruminate or distract from rumination, before being asked to complete cognitive tasks. These rumination and distraction induc-tions may produce stronger differences in cognitive per-formance in the laboratory compared to selecting par-ticipants based on their RSQ-D score.   However, there are some limitations to this study that should be addressed in future research. The first limita-tion is due to the outpatient MDD sample. Only 3 of 21 patients of the high-rumination group were male. There-fore, no conclusions can be drawn about the influence of gender. Furthermore, the variance of rumination scores in this sample was restricted; therefore, our results might underestimate the association between rumination and cognitive deficits. Further research should extend the sample in addition to inpatients and healthy controls. Secondly, one could argue that the lack of impact of ru-mination on some cognitive domains is due to the com-puting of the neuropsychological variables. Our cognitive performance parameters were computed by combining the test scores into a single index of specific cognitive do-mains. The score of the attention domain demonstrated Downloaded from http://karger.com/psp/article-pdf/50/5/347/3492414/000478785.pdf by UNC Chapel Hill user on 09 January 2024 Cognitive Impairments in Unipolar Depression Psychopathology 2017;50:347–354DOI: 10.1159/000478785353moderate internal consistency (α = 0.63) and was below the recommended Cronbach α of 0.70. In this respect, it is worth mentioning that the attention score was the only one with α < 0.70; all other computed domain scores showed a high internal consistency (α > 0.80). The third problem concerns the unequal distribution of partici-pants. The group of low ruminators was almost twice as large as that of the high ruminators. This restricted only the mean value analyses on the basis of  t  tests, but not the hierarchical regression analysis. Finally, it is also impor-tant to note that the present study did not allow us to draw any causal conclusions about the relationship between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD. Due to the limitations mentioned above, it is important to verify whether our results can be generalized.  The current findings offer new insights into the fre-quently observed link between rumination and cognitive impairments in MDD. We have proved that patients who tend to ruminate in everyday life only show limitations in processing speed, but not a general reduction in their cog-nitive performance. For a limited period of time they can exhibit the cognitive performance comparable to that of low ruminators. Inpatients and healthy controls should be included in the samples of subsequent studies to enable generalization of this study’s findings. Another question unanswered by this study concerns the point in time at which attention starts to tilt and provide space for rumi-nation under conditions of increasing cognitive demands. These prevailing ruminating thoughts can occupy cogni-tive resources and lead to a decreased cognitive perfor-mance, as shown in many experimental studies. This question is highly relevant in everyday life and highlights the necessity for further investigations.

Four characteristics—rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms—are thought to be  associated with the development of ADA. However, the complex relationships among these factors have not been clarified. In this study, we aimed to examine the mechanism by which these four characteristics influence the development of ADA.Methods:  We conducted a structured interview about ADA with 332 outpatients, who completed several self-report measures, to assess rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms.Results:  A structural equation model showed goodness-of-fit with the data. These findings suggest that rejection sensitivity may demonstrate a direct effect on the occurrence of ADA. Furthermore, rejection sensitivity might affect depressive symptoms through rumination and social anxiety symptoms and consequently contribute to the development of ADA.Conclusion:  These results provide preliminary evidence that rejection sensitivity contributes to the development of ADA.KEYWORDSanxious-depressive attack, rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptomsTYPE Original ResearchPUBLISHED  30 November 2022DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879OPEN ACCESSEDITED BYJiabao Lin,  Université Claude Bernard Lyon 1, FranceREVIEWED BYGiovanni Mansueto,  University of Florence,  ItalyDara Kiu Yi Leung,  The University of Hong Kong,  Hong Kong SAR, China*CORRESPONDENCEShota Nodanorashouta@outlook.jpSPECIALTY SECTIONThis article was submitted to Psychopathology,  a section of the journal  Frontiers in PsychologyRECEIVED 11 August 2022ACCEPTED 01 November 2022PUBLISHED 30 November 2022CITATIONNoda S, Masaki M, Kishimoto T and Kaiya H (2022) Effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of anxious-depressive attack in Japanese outpatients: The mediating roles of rumination, social anxiety, and depressive symptoms.Front.

Table 1  presents the diagnostic criteria of ADA ( Kaiya et al., 2020 , revised). The prevalence of ADA among new patients visiting clinics for mood and anxiety disorders was estimated to be 16.88% (Matsumoto et al., 2020 ). ADA is a trans-diagnostic symptom complex, and many affected patients demonstrate comorbid mood and anxiety disorders, such as major depressive episodes, agoraphobia, social anxiety disorder (SAD), generalized anxiety disorder, and panic disorder ( Kaiya, 2016 ; Noda et  al., 2021 ). Patients with severe ADA symptoms tend to exhibit severe anxiety and depressive symptoms ( Kaiya, 2017 ; Noda et  al., 2021 ). In many affected patients, ADA causes moderate to severe disturbances to activities of daily living ( Noda et al., 2021 ).Results of a previous study indicated that rejection sensitivity plays a role in the development of ADA in patients with SAD in the following three ways: (1) rejection sensitivity triggers ADA directly; (2) rejection sensitivity intensifies depressive symptoms, which leads to ADA; and (3) rejection sensitivity intensifies social anxiety symptoms, which worsens depressive symptoms, which in turn leads to ADA ( Kaiya et al., 2020 ). That study showed that rejection sensitivity is of central importance in the occurrence of ADA.Rejection sensitivity refers to a disposition toward anxious anticipation, ready perception, and overreaction to rejection (Downey and Feldman, 1996 ). Rejection sensitivity is a criterion specifying atypical features in bipolar and related disorders and depressive disorders as per the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5; American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). Rejection sensitivity is also one of the core characteristics of SAD ( Liebowitz, 1987 ; Harb et al., 2002 ), and leads to clinically troublesome pathological states or conditions, such as suicidal ideation ( Brown et  al., 2019 ), aggression and victimization ( Gao et al., 2021 ), social–emotional maladjustment (Godleski et al., 2019 ), and low self-esteem and loneliness ( Zhou et  al., 2020 ). Rejection sensitivity is associated with anxiety, depressive symptoms, loneliness, borderline personality disorder, and body dysmorphic disorder ( Gao et al., 2017 ) and is thought to be caused by family conflict and maternal harshness in both childhood and adulthood ( Godleski et al., 2019 ).Rejection sensitivity increases rumination ( Pearson et  al., 2011 ), which is characterized by obsessional thinking involving excessive, repetitive thoughts of themes that interfere with other forms of mental activity ( American Psychological Association, n.d.). Nolen-Hoeksema et al. (2008)  demonstrated that rumination predicts the onset of depression, exacerbates depression, enhances negative thinking, impairs problem-solving skills, interferes with instrumental behavior, and erodes social support. Rumination may also be  an important sign of severe clinical symptoms, including depression, dysphoria, suicidal ideation, cognitive complaints, post-traumatic stress symptoms, and aggression, in patients with a history of childhood adversities ( Mansueto et al., 2021 ). Furthermore, rumination is associated with several psychological symptoms, including eating disorders ( Palmieri et al., 2021 ) and emotion regulation difficulties ( Mansueto et al., 2022 ). According to Pearson et al. (2011) , rumination correlates with a specific maladaptive interpersonal style consisting of submissive (overly accommodating, nonassertive, and self-sacrificing) behaviors characteristic of SAD. Individuals with SAD or major depressive disorder reported higher levels of rumination than healthy controls, with no difference in the levels of rumination between the two disorders. Moreover, the comorbidity of these two disorders is prominently associated with rumination (Arditte Hall et al., 2019 ). The intensity of social anxiety correlates with rumination over time in patients undergoing cognitive–behavioral therapy for SAD ( Brozovich et al., 2015 ).SAD is closely related to depression. A national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions revealed that the lifetime prevalence of any mood disorder among patients with SAD was 56.3% ( Grant et al., 2005 ). In Japan, SAD is a strong predictor of the first onset of depression ( Tsuchiya et al., 2009 ). Compared with SAD alone, the combination of SAD and depression exhibits a more malignant course characterized by an increased risk of suicide attempts and disease chronicity ( Stein, 2006 ). Individuals TABLE 1 Diagnostic criteria for anxious-depressive attack.A. Anxious-depressive attack occurs suddenly and recurrently regardless of one’s situation in various mental disorders.B. The following symptoms occur in descending order of frequency, but symptom no. 4 is not always present:1. Abrupt surge of intense discomfort, consisting of mixed emotions of an anxious and depressive nature, with or without the urge to weep. The discomfort peaks within several seconds or less than a minute after onset.2. Intrusive rumination, including mostly negative memories, consisting of mainly recent or past adverse events (flashbacks) or, in rare cases, worry, which continues for a range of time from several minutes to several hours.3. Prominent agitation, unrest, or loneliness that occurs during rumination and is occasionally very violent and inappropriate in comparison to ruminative subjects.4. Various coping behaviors to manage intense discomfort occasionally appear.C. Physical symptoms (e.g., shortness of breath and palpitations) are extremely mild.D. The disturbance is not attributable to the direct psychological effects of any stress, physiological effects of a substance, or a neurological or other medical condition.E. The disturbance is not better explained by another neuropsychiatric disorder (e.g., panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, nonepileptic seizure, frontal epilepsy, intermittent explosive disorder, anxious distress specified for depression, sudden emotional excitement of schizophrenia, or Ataque de nervios ).Adapted from Kaiya et al. (2020) , with permission from The Japanese Society of Anxiety and Related Disorders (JSARD).Noda et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879Frontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.orgwith depression comorbid with anxiety disorders, especially SAD, often exhibit atypical features. Koyuncu et al. (2015)  reported that 77.1% of depression comorbid with SAD was atypical.Based on the information above, rejection sensitivity, rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms, especially with atypical features, have mutual relationships and may contribute to the pathogenesis of ADA. Thus, to reanalyze the pathogenesis of ADA using structural equation modeling (SEM), in the current study, we added rumination as a causative element in patients with SAD and in other patients who visited anxiety-depression clinics. We hypothesized that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA. To examine the relationship among these variables, we  constructed a hypothetical model (Figure 1 ) and examined the validity of the model.Materials and methodsParticipantsParticipants were outpatients seeking treatment at a clinic for mood and anxiety disorders in Nagoya/Aichi Prefecture, Japan, aged ≥18 years. Exclusion criteria included high suicide risk, severe physical illness, and significant cognitive impairment. After we obtained written informed consent, 421 outpatients participated in the survey. Of these, 332 completed all the scales and participated in the interview. To examine the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA, we analyzed the data of these 332 participants.Diagnosis and measuresMental illness was diagnosed in accordance with the DSM-5 (American Psychiatric Association, 2013 ). In addition, ADA was diagnosed through a structured interview with the participants using the diagnostic criteria for ADA ( Kaiya, 2017 ). ADA was regarded as present only when the diagnoses of one of the two psychiatrists (Tomokazu Kishimoto and Hisanobu Kaiya) and a psychologist (Mina Masaki) were in agreement. We  used the following self-administered measures to assess patients’ symptoms:Japanese version of the interpersonal sensitivity measureThe interpersonal sensitivity measure (IPSM) was developed by Boyce and Parker (1989)  to assess the tendency to be sensitive to rejection by others. Each item is scored from 1 (very unlike you) to 4 (very like you). Suyama et al. (2014)  developed the Japanese version of the IPSM, which consists of five subscales, including “fear of breakup of a relationship, ” “unassertive interpersonal behavior due to fear of hurting others, ” “fear of criticism by others, ” “discrepancy between social self-image and true self-image, ” and “obsequence to others. ” The scale has 27 items, and the total score ranges from 27 to 108, with higher scores indicating greater sensitivity to rejection by others. The Japanese version of the IPSM has good internal consistency and convergent validity ( Suyama et  al., 2014 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach’s α = 0.92).Japanese version of the ruminative response scaleThe ruminative response scale (RRS) was developed by Treynor et  al. (2003)  to assess rumination about brooding, reflection, and depressive symptoms. The scale consists of 22 items, and each item is scored from 1 (almost never) to 4 (almost always). The total score ranges from 22 to 88, with higher scores indicating greater rumination. The Japanese version of the RRS has good internal consistency, test–retest reliability, and convergent validity ( Hasegawa, 2013 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach’s α = 0.94).Japanese version of the Liebowitz social anxiety scaleThe Liebowitz social anxiety scale (LSAS) was developed by Liebowitz (1987)  to assess social anxiety symptoms reflected by anxiety and avoidance of social situations. The scale consists of 24 items each for anxiety and avoidance behavior. The sum of these items is the score for social anxiety symptoms. Each item is rated on a 4-point scale from 0 (none on the anxiety scale and never on the avoidance behavior scale) to 3 (severe on the anxiety scale and usually on the avoidance behavior scale). The total score ranges from 0 to 144, with higher scores indicating greater social anxiety symptoms. The Japanese version of the LSAS has good internal consistency, test–retest reliability, factorial validity, and convergent validity ( Asakura et al., 2002 ; Okajima et al., 2007 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach’s α = 0.98).Japanese version of the quick inventory of depressive symptomatologyThe quick inventory of depressive symptomatology (QIDS) was developed by Rush et  al. (2003)  to assess depressive symptoms according to nine symptom domains in major depressive disorder, including sleep and appetite/weight change. Items are scored from 0 to 3. The total score ranges from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depressive symptoms. The Japanese version of the QIDS has good internal consistency and convergent validity ( Fujisawa et al., 2010 ) and exhibited good internal consistency in this study (Cronbach’s α = 0.84).Statistical analysesFirst, chi-square and t-tests were used to compare patients with and without ADA. Second, using weighted least-squares mean-and variance-adjusted estimators, SEM was performed to determine how rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the association between rejection sensitivity and ADA. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Noda et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879Frontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.orgversion 25 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY , the United States) was used to conduct the chi-square and t-tests, and SEM was performed using Mplus 8 ( Muthén and Muthén, 1998 –2017 ).Ethical considerationsThis study was approved by the Medical Corporation Warakukai Ethics Review Board. Written informed consent was obtained from all participants prior to their enrollment in the study.ResultsDemographics of patientsTable  2  lists psychiatrists’ diagnoses and the clinical characteristics of the participants. Of the 332 patients, 141 were men, and 191 were women (mean age, 34.35 ± 12.92 years). Depressive disorders were diagnosed in 103 patients (31.02%) and anxiety disorders in 97 (29.22%). The presence of ADA was confirmed in 59 patients (12 men and 47 women; mean age, 27.73 ± 7.15 years) and the absence of ADA in 273 patients (129 men and 144 women; mean age, 35.78 ± 13.45 years). Thus, the prevalence of ADA was 17.77%. Furthermore, the patient group with ADA consisted of more females and younger patients than the group of patients without ADA (p < 0.01). Patients with ADA demonstrated high rates of comorbidity, including major depressive disorder (33.90%), major depressive disorder with atypical features (28.81%), SAD (8.47%), panic disorder (6.78%), and panic disorder with agoraphobia (5.08%). The rate of comorbid major depressive disorder with atypical features was significantly higher in patients with ADA compared with the rate in patients without ADA ( p < 0.01).SEMThe results of the hypothesized model showed goodness-of-fit with the data ( χ2 = 0.10, df = 1, p = 0.76; comparative fit index = 1.000; Tucker–Lewis Index = 1.000; root mean square error of approximation = 0.000, 90% confidence interval = 0.000–0.099; and standardized root mean square residual = 0.004). The standardized parameter estimates for rejection sensitivity were significant with regard to rumination ( β = 0.60, p < 0.001), social anxiety symptoms (β = 0.42, p < 0.001), depressive symptoms ( β = 0.11, p < 0.05), and ADA (β = 0.22, p < 0.05). The estimates for rumination were significant with regard to social anxiety symptoms ( β = 0.28, p < 0.001) and depressive symptoms ( β = 0.50, p < 0.001).

The model is shown in Figure 1 .DiscussionThe present study aimed to determine the association between rejection sensitivity and rumination, social anxiety symptoms, depressive symptoms, and ADA in Japanese outpatients who visited a mood and anxiety disorder clinic. We  hypothesized that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms demonstrate significant mediating effects on the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA, and we used SEM to test this hypothesis. The results of SEM showed that the hypothesized model’s goodness-of-fit indices demonstrated high values. Our SEM model matched substantially, which can be explained by the two reasons. Firstly, our previous research ( Kaiya et al., 2020 ) has established a model similar to the present model, except for the item of ruminative thinking. Secondly, as mentioned in the introduction, a close relationship between the variables in our SEM model has been clinically demonstrated. This suggested that (1) rejection sensitivity is directly associated with ADA, (2) depressive symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and ADA, and (3) social anxiety symptoms mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms; all these findings are consistent TABLE 2 Clinical characteristics of participants.Demographics All patients ( N = 332) Patients with ADA (n = 59)Patients without ADA (n = 273)Chi-square value/ t-valueNumber of men 141 (100%) 12 (8.51%) 129 (91.49%) 14.38**Mean age ( SD) 34.35 (±12.92) 27.73 (±7.15) 35.78 (±13.45) 6.51**Primary diagnosis, nAutism spectrum disorder 3 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 3 (100%) 0.65Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder 14 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 14 (100%) 3.16Delusional disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Schizophrenia†3 (100%) 1 (33.33%) 2 (66.67%) 0.50Bipolar disorder†6 (100%) 1 (16.67%) 5 (83.33%) 0.01Major depressive disorder†80 (100%) 20 (25.00%) 60 (75.00%) 3.77Major depressive disorder with atypical features†19 (100%) 17 (89.47%) 2 (10.53%) 70.91**Major depressive disorder with a seasonal pattern2 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 2 (100%) 0.44Persistent depressive disorder 2 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 2 (100%) 0.44Specific phobia†8 (100%) 1 (12.50%) 7 (87.50%) 0.16Social anxiety disorder†37 (100%) 5 (13.51%) 32 (86.49%) 0.52Panic disorder†29 (100%) 4 (13.79%) 25 (86.21%) 0.34Agoraphobia†1 (100%) 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 4.64Panic disorder with agoraphobia†18 (100%) 3 (16.67%) 15 (83.33%) 0.02Generalized anxiety disorder 4 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 4 (100%) 0.88Obsessive–compulsive disorder†18 (100%) 2 (11.11%) 16 (88.89%) 0.58Post-traumatic stress disorder 3 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 3 (100%) 0.65Acute stress disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Adjustment disorder 17 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 17 (100%) 3.87Insomnia disorder†15 (100%) 1 (6.67%) 14 (93.33%) 1.33Narcolepsy 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Unspecified personality disorder 1 (100%) 0 (0.00%) 1 (100%) 0.22Depressive state†14 (100%) 2 (14.29%) 12 (85.71%) 0.12Other (unspecified or other symptoms)†35 (100%) 1 (2.86%) 34 (97.14%) 5.96*Descriptive statisticsInterpersonal sensitivity measure 77.52 (±14.08) 86.27 (±10.73) 75.63 (±14.02) −6.41**Ruminative responses scale 53.52 (±15.65) 63.46 (±11.96) 51.38 (±15.54) −6.64**Quick inventory of depressive symptomatology11.97 (±5.80) 16.08 (±4.58) 11.08 (±5.65) −6.37**Liebowitz social anxiety scale 48.73 (±35.23) 68.49 (±34.32) 44.46 (±34.00) −4.91**ADA, anxious-depressive attack; SD, standard deviation; †Includes patients with ADA; *p < 0.05; **p < 0.01.Noda et al. 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1016879Frontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.orgwith those in a previous study ( Kaiya et  al., 2020 ). In addition, rumination was shown to mediate the relationship between rejection sensitivity and social anxiety or depressive symptoms. The relationship between rejection sensitivity and rumination was significant, but that between rumination and ADA was not. Therefore, we consider that rumination is not directly associated with ADA but is associated with depressive symptoms that trigger ADA. These findings suggest that depressive symptoms may mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA and that rumination and social anxiety symptoms may mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on depressive symptoms that trigger ADA.In the present study, the prevalence rates of ADA in all subjects and in patients with atypical depression were 17.77 and 89.54%, respectively, which were compatible with those of our previous reports ( Kaiya, 2017 ; Matsumoto et  al., 2020 ). The finding that ADA was most common in atypical depression is reasonable because rejection sensitivity, which is considered one of the basic psychopathological manifestations of ADA, as shown in this study, was reported as a symptom of high diagnostic significance in atypical depression ( Thase, 2009 ).The severity of ADA symptoms is positively associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms, and ADA symptoms disrupt the lives of many affected patients ( Noda et al., 2021 ). Therefore, in patients with anxiety and depressive symptoms, ADA should be identified as early as possible. In this study, rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms were directly related to ADA, which suggests that patients with high levels of rejection sensitivity and depressive symptoms are at a high risk for developing ADA.Furthermore, this model suggests that rejection sensitivity is an important predictor of ADA. Therefore, interventions targeting rejection sensitivity should be implemented in the management and prevention of ADA. Mindfulness training may be  an option for treating ADA. Trait mindfulness is negatively associated with rejection sensitivity ( Sheng et  al., 2022 ). In particular, the nonjudgment factor of trait mindfulness negatively predicts rejection sensitivity ( Peters et al., 2016 ). Keng and Tan (2018)  demonstrated that brief mindfulness training is effective in improving negative affect and feelings of rejection after social rejection. Furthermore, mindfulness training is effective in improving rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms ( Deyo et al., 2009 ; Goldin and Gross, 2010 ). These findings suggest that mindfulness training may be an effective intervention for ADA.This study has several limitations. First, a longitudinal design should be  used to assess the associations among the variables addressed in this study to validate a causal relationship. In the model that we constructed, the direction of causality was assumed based on the results of previous studies, and its validity was examined. However, a cross-sectional design was used in this study; thus, the causal relationships among these variables could not be established. Second, this study was conducted in a specialized clinic for anxiety and depression. Because most patients visiting this clinic present with anxiety and depressive disorders, the possibility exists that the results may have been biased. Future studies should be conducted in hospitals and clinics that specialize in a wide range of mental illnesses. Third, patients who visited the clinic for the first time were included in this study, and the eligibility criteria included patients treated with and without pharmacotherapy. The model should be assessed separately for patients treated with pharmacotherapy and patients who were not treated with pharmacotherapy. Finally, the development of ADA should be  further tested. Adverse childhood experiences and childhood emotional abuse/maltreatment are associated with rejection sensitivity, rumination, and clinical symptoms ( Chesin et al., 2015 ; Pierce et al., 2018 ; Mansueto et al., 2021 ). A model showing the effects of rejection sensitivity on ADA could be established in the future.ConclusionThis study provides preliminary evidence suggesting that rumination, social anxiety symptoms, and depressive symptoms mediate the effect of rejection sensitivity on the development of ADA. This evidence is an impetus for future research to understand the psychopathogenesis of ADA and its treatment.Data availability statementDetailed data are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.Ethics statementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by Medical Corporation Warakukai Ethics Review Board.

They also havefrequently comorbid depression that can be considered a possible explanation for their cognitive dys-function. We evaluated the cognitive performance of patients with CFS in comparison with a controlgroup of healthy volunteers and a group of patients with MDD.Patients and methods: Twenty-ﬁve patients with CFS, 25 patients with major depressive disorder (MDD),and 25 healthy control subjects were given standardized tests of attention, working memory, and ver-bal and visual episodic memory, and were also tested for effects related to lack of effort/simulation,suggestibility, and fatigue.Results: Patients with CFS had slower phasic alertness, and also had impaired working, visual and verbalepisodic memory compared to controls. They were, however, no more sensitive than the other groups tosuggestibility or to fatigue induced during the cognitive session. Cognitive impairments in MDD patientswere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue; in patients with CFS, there was a weakercorrelation between cognition and depression (and no correlation with fatigue).Conclusions: This study conﬁrms the presence of an objective impairment in attention and memory inpatients with CFS but with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated suggestibility.© 2011 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.1. IntroductionChronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a debilitating condition that ischaracterized by chronic fatigue, impairment of short-term mem-ory and musculoskeletal pain [1]. CFS is marked by persistent orrelapsing debilitating fatigue that: (1) does not resolve with bedrest; (2) is severe enough to reduce daily activity; and (3) has nosomatic explanation [2]. A number of symptoms may be present,including myalgia, headache, sore throat, and pains in the joints.Cognitive complaints are also frequently reported, particularly inrelation to memory and concentration [3–7] . However, althoughpatients with CFS often complain of cognitive difﬁculties, neu-ropsychological studies that have attempted to objectively measurecognitive deﬁcits in such patients have yielded conﬂicting results./H22845Data presented at the APA meeting in Washington, May 6, 2008, poster NR5-047.∗Corresponding author at: Service de psychiatrie, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Avenue Hippocrate 10, 1200 Bruxelles, Belgium. Tel.: +32 2 764 21 75;fax: +32 2 764 89 21.E-mail address: Eric.Constant@uclouvain.be (E.L. Constant).Subjective ratings of cognitive competence are poor predictors oflaboratory results [7], because they can be based on factors otherthan competence, such as emotional distress, fatigue, or malaise.In objective cognitive tests, authors have found that patients withCFS usually perform in the normal range for general intellec-tual abilities (WAIS: [3,8] ; and NART: [8]) and higher cognitivefunctions (planning, verbal ﬂuency, abstract reasoning, problemsolving; see: [3–5,9–12] ). Data are less consistent for attentionand memory: some authors have reported impairment in ver-bal memory [5,10,13] , visual memory [5], concentration [6,11,13] ,attention span [6], reaction times [14–16] , and speed of infor-mation processing [4,10] , while others found no abnormalities inverbal memory [3,12,13,15] , visual memory [3,5,11,17] , concentra-tion [7,10] , attention span [5,6,10,11] , or reaction times [5]. Theseconﬂicting results raise questions about the methodology of thesestudies and the objectivity of the tests used to assess the cognitiveimpairments. There is, indeed, a marked discrepancy between sub-jective complaints and objective performance that casts doubt onthe validity of the cognitive symptoms. In one study [10] , despiteno memory deﬁcits on neuropsychological tests, patients withCFS had more subjective complaints of cognitive impairment on0303-8467/$ – see front matter © 2011 Elsevier B.V.

Such an explanation would sufﬁce if a correlationbetween symptoms of depression and anxiety and certain neu-ropsychological measures had been observed (as for example instudies [6,7,11,17,21] ). However, this is not the case in all studies[3–5,13,15,22–25] . In addition, the possible direct effect of fatigueon cognitive performance in CFS has also been examined. Althoughmost authors [5,6,25–27] found no relationship between the levelof fatigue and performance on memory and attention tests, one wasnoted by Joyce et al. [13] . Thus, the direct effect of fatigue on cogni-tive performance in CFS remains unclear. In another condition, thepost-polio syndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also did not ﬁnd a relation-ship between general fatigue and cognitive deﬁcits. Finally, thereare multiple methodological difﬁculties in the neuropsychologicalliterature on CFS, for example, heterogeneity in the diagnosis of CFSacross studies, presence of comorbid depression, and lack of controlgroups.It is, therefore, difﬁcult to clarify whether there are objectivecognitive deﬁcits in patients with CFS, particularly in terms of mem-ory and executive functions, or whether the cognitive impairmentsare directly associated with the depressive symptoms in this con-dition. Hence, we evaluated as a primary objective, the cognitiveperformance of patients with CFS using standardized verbal andvisual memory tests, as well as sustained attention, phasic alert-ness, and the fatigue effect, compared with a control group ofhealthy volunteers. We investigated the same variables in a groupof patients with MDD. Particular attention was paid to the evalua-tion of the quantitative dimension of depressive symptoms in thepatients with CFS. Investigation of attention and memory functionswas chosen because these are the functions most often reportedas impaired in CFS but also in MDD. Our primary hypothesis wasthat patients with CFS would have cognitive impairments that wereonly partially correlated with the depressive dimension of the con-dition, suggesting that some cognitive impairments may be presentindependent of the depressive dimension. The partial relationshipbetween cognitive and depressive symptomatology could be con-ﬁrmed by direct comparison with the MDD group.In addition to these primary objectives, we wanted to inves-tigate the possible gap between the subjective and objectivedimensions of cognition, as some studies have reported moresubjective complaints than objective impairments. Our secondaryobjectives were, therefore, to examine the subjects’ reactions tosuggestibility. Some authors [29] have argued that subjects withCFS are more suggestible than healthy persons using a measure ofgeneral suggestibility and the hypnotic induction proﬁle (HIP) [30] .Another way to approach this question would be to investigate taskinvolvement in order to exclude deﬁcit feigning and the attributionof cognitive deﬁcits to the possibility that CFS patients may be lessthan optimally motivated in the tasks (thus expending less effortbecause of a metacognitive belief of cognitive impairment).2. Materials and methods2.1. SubjectsWe studied 25 patients with CFS, 25 patients with MDD,and 25 healthy control subjects (see Table 1 for demographicparameters of these three groups). All of the participants wereright-handed. There was no signiﬁcant among-group differencefor age [ F(2,72) = .64; p= .52]. There was a signiﬁcant differencein degree of education among the three groups [ F(2,72] = 10.41;p< .01], with the MDD group having fewer years of education thanthe CFS and control groups (both p< .01). The groups were compa-rable for gender [ /US2(2, 75) = 3.86, p> .10].All the CFS patients met the diagnostic criterion for CFS, i.e., atleast six months of unexplained disabling fatigue [1,2] . CFS subjectswere recruited from the Referral Centre for CFS and MDD patientsfrom the outpatient psychiatric unit of the Cliniques UniversitairesSaint-Luc, Brussels. The healthy controls were recruited from thecare staff and volunteers of the Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Lucand from volunteer associations. Before entering the study, patientsand controls gave their informed consent to a protocol approved bythe Medical Ethics Committee of the School of Medicine of the Uni-versité catholique de Louvain. The patients and the control subjectsunderwent a psychiatric interview supplemented by the StructuralClinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID) [31] to conﬁrmthe diagnosis of unipolar major depressive episodes in the patientswith MDD and the absence of any Axis I psychiatric disorder inthe controls and the patients with CFS (in particular the absence ofMDD). Exclusion criteria for the control subjects were unexplainedfatigue, an organic condition that causes fatigue, an unstable med-ical condition, an organic brain disorder, the use of psychotropicdrugs, and a current or past mental disorder on the basis of theSCID I interview.2.2. Procedure2.2.1. Self-questionnairesSeveral scales were used to assess anxiety, depression, andfatigue. The 40-item State Trait Anxiety Inventory Scale (STAI A&B ) [32] assesses anxiety symptoms. The ﬁrst sub-scale indicatesthe state of anxiety at the moment of the session (STAI-A); thesecond sub-scale indicates the subject’s anxiety traits (STAI-B).The results are converted into T-scores. A French version of the21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) [33] assesses depressionin adults [34] . The scores range from 0 to 63. A score of 13 orless indicates a non-depressed state; a score from 14 to 19 corre-sponds to “mildly depressed”; and a score over 20 indicates clinicaldepression. The geriatric depression scale (GDS) [35] is a 30-iteminstrument for assessing depression. The value of this questionnaireis that physical symptoms are excluded, whereas other instrumentsof depression assessment are too rich in somatic symptoms andtoo poor in cognitive symptoms. Scores range from 0 to 30. A scoreof 10 or less is considered to indicate the absence of depressivesymptoms, and a score over 11 reﬂects the presence of depressivesymptoms. The fatigue severity scale (FSS) [36] is a 9-item scaleassessing “disabling fatigue”. Total scores range from 9 to 63. Thehigher the score, the more the fatigue is disabling.E.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295–302 2972.2.2. Cognitive tasksAttention was assessed with one computerized reaction timetest: the Phasic Alertness Task of the TEA1.5 battery [37] . In thistask, the subject is instructed to press a button as quickly as possibleas soon as a cross appears in the centre of the screen. In one con-dition, the cross is preceded by a warning signal (i.e., a beep) whilein the other condition there is no warning signal. The median reac-tion time for correctly detected crosses is calculated for each of thetwo conditions (i.e., with and without an audible warning signal).Phasic alertness reﬂects optimization of the state of preparation orreactivity of a subject when the information he/she has to deal withis preceded by a signal warning of its imminent appearance.In addition to this reaction time task, two working memory taskswere administered. The ﬁrst was the computerized working mem-ory task of the TEA1.5 battery [37] where the subject has to presson a button when a given stimulus (a digit which appears in thecentre of the screen) is identical to a stimulus shown previously(the next to last digit shown on the screen). A hundred digits from1 to 9 were presented in succession at 3-s inter-stimulus intervals.The median reaction time for correct responses and the numbersof correct responses and errors are recorded. The second workingmemory task was the computerized paced auditory serial attentiontest (PASAT) [38] where single digits are presented auditorily. Sub-jects were instructed to add each new digit to the one immediatelyprior to it. The test score is the total number of correct sums givenin each trial.Finally, two episodic memory tasks (one verbal and the othervisual) were also administered. The verbal task was the word mem-ory test (WMT) [39] . This computerized memory test measures theability to learn a list of 20 pairs of words displayed on the screen,e.g., pig/bacon. There are then six sub-tests: immediate recogni-tion (IR), delayed recognition (DR), multiple choice (MC), pairedassociates (PA), free recall (FR), and long delayed free recall (LDFR).Visual episodic memory was assessed using the “Doors test” [40] inwhich subjects are instructed to memorize two series of 12 picturesof doors (garage doors, front doors, etc.). Each door is shown for 3 sand then the subject is asked to recognize the door (target items)from a choice of four pictures of doors (score ranging between 0and 24).2.2.3. Cognitive fatigue assessmentIn addition to the subjective assessment of fatigue using thefatigue severity scale, we assessed fatigue more objectively byadministering the phasic alertness part of the TEA again at theend of the testing session (which took approximately an hour anda half). A fatigue index (total reaction times of Alertness test 2minus total reaction times of Alertness test 1) was calculated andcompared among groups using an ANOVA. A higher fatigue indexindicated a stronger effect of fatigue on phasic alertness.2.2.4. Suggestibility and lack of effort (simulation)We also added some tasks and/or indexes assessing suggestibil-ity and lack of effort. Suggestibility is deﬁned as the tendency torespond to suggestions. The effect of suggestibility was assessed bydividing the PASAT into two equal parts. Half-way through the testthere was a pause, and the investigator said: “Now, after this ﬁrstpart of the test, you probably feel a certain degree of fatigue, whichwe will investigate before going on with the task”. The subject hadto assess his/her subjective fatigue on a 7-point Likert scale (fatigueseverity scale, FSS, ranging from “no fatigue” to “extreme fatigue”).A suggestibility index (total score of PASAT 2 minus total score ofPASAT 1) was calculated and compared among the groups using anANOVA. A higher negative index indicated a greater deteriorationof scores on PASAT 2 and thus a greater response to suggestibility.For the assessment of simulation (or lack of effort), we useda speciﬁc task: the Amsterdam Short Memory Test (short version)[41] . This task comprises 45 items. Each item involves the presenta-tion of ﬁve words from a common semantic category (e.g., x, y, z, w,v). Subjects have to read the words aloud and memorize them. Theyare then distracted with a simple addition or subtraction task. Afterthis short interference task, ﬁve words from the original seman-tic category are presented (e.g., x, y, z, a, b). Three words are thesame as in the previous trial, and two are new and less frequent forthat category. Subjects have to indicate which three words werepresent in the ﬁrst series (no time limit). The test score is the num-ber of correct responses; the maximum score is 45 (3 points foreach 15 items). In a preliminary study, we showed that a cut-offscore of 40/45 (the lowest score obtained by a group of patientswith marked cerebral damage and severe amnesia) was the bestthreshold to detect subjects asked to feign a memory deﬁcit (thesesubjects having a weaker score).In addition to this speciﬁc task, some index of simulation canalso be extracted from the WMT and the Doors tests. Indeed, IRand DR sub-tests from the WMT are particularly sensitive to lackof effort. The consistency of the responses from IR to DR is calcu-lated. This score allows investigation of lack of effort or simulation.The person receives a point if the correct response was chosen inthe two sub-tests or if the incorrect response was chosen in thetwo sub-tests and receives a score of zero if responses were incon-sistent for a given item, scoring “correctly” with some trials and“incorrectly” with others. The cut off score is <70%. Using this score,the performance of the subject can be questioned [42] . In the Doorstest, the subject’s score is compared to chance performance. Indeed,it is widely recognized that amnesic patients use implicit memory(or familiarity) to recognize the target item, and perform betterthan chance in most recognition tasks. Hence, if the subject’s per-formance is signiﬁcantly near to or less than that of chance (here25% correct which is a score of 6/24), the examiner may concludethat the examinee has intentionally chosen incorrect responses andmay have been motivated to perform inadequately [43] .2.3. Data analysisData were analyzed with Statistica 5.0. The groups were com-pared using a univariate analysis of variance (ANOVA). The LSDtest or planned comparisons (post hoc comparisons) were calcu-lated. The statistical signiﬁcance for all of the analyses was set at˛= .05.3. Results3.1. Depression, anxiety and subjective fatigueFirst analyses of the questionnaires (see Table 2 ) showed a sig-niﬁcant main effect for each index. Post hoc analysis suggested thatpatients with CFS were more depressed than controls on the BDIand GDS questionnaires, but less depressed than the MDD group.The same pattern was observed for anxiety with patients withCFS being more anxious than the control subjects, but less anx-ious than the patients with MDD. Concerning subjective fatigue,patients with CFS were signiﬁcantly more tired than the depressedand control groups. Moreover, the patients with MDD had a higherfatigue score than the control group.3.2. Do patients with CFS have cognitive deﬁcits?Our ﬁrst question was to verify whether patients with CFS hadcognitive impairments compared to control subjects. Results forthe CFS and control groups are presented in Table 3 . Comparedwith normal controls, patients with CFS subjects had slower totalmedian RT and median RT without signal on the ﬁrst alertness sub-test (TEA) but not median RT with signal.

For the working memory tasks, CFSpatients had longer median times and fewer correct responses thancontrols on the working memory (TEA) and a tendency for lowertotal scores on the PASAT. It is also interesting to note that for theworking memory (TEA) there was a negative correlation betweenmedian time and length of illness ( r=−.4563; p= .022) and betweencorrect responses and length of illness ( r=−.4331; p= .031), sug-gesting that the longer the duration of the CFS, the more impairedthe patients were on this cognitive test. For the visual memory task(Doors test), patients with CFS had lower total scores than did con-trol subjects. For verbal episodic memory (WMT), CFS patients hadlower scores on DR, FR and LDFR and a tendency to lower scores onMC.3.3.

Moreover, a univariate ANOVA on thegroups showed a signiﬁcant main effect for group on the medianRT of response. There was no signiﬁcant difference between theMDD group and the controls, but both differed from the patientswith CFS who were slower. For the total PASAT scores, there was atendency for lower scores in CFS patients compared with controls,and both differed from the patients with MDD depressed who wereless effective.For the memory tasks, a univariate ANOVA on the visual mem-ory task (Doors) revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for group.There was no signiﬁcant difference in the quality of responsesbetween the MDD and CFS groups, but both differed from thecontrol group, which was more effective. A univariate ANOVA onthe WMT revealed a signiﬁcant main effect for group for DR, MC,FR, LDFR. For DR, MC and FR, patients with MDD and those withCFS had lower scores than controls with no difference betweenMDD and CFS patients. However, and notably, patients with CFSshowed worse performances for the LDFR compared to controlsand patients with MDD, but these latter groups did not differ fromeach other.3.4. Effect of fatigueRegarding the impact of objective fatigue, a univariate ANOVAon the fatigue index (total reaction times of Alertness test 2 minustotal reaction times of Alertness test 1), showed no signiﬁcant groupeffect suggesting that all groups were inﬂuenced equally by theeffect of fatigue.3.5. Subject’s response to suggestibilityConcerning suggestibility, a univariate ANOVA on the sug-gestibility index revealed a tendency for a signiﬁcant main groupeffect; post hoc analysis showed only a tendency for patients withMDD to be more suggestible than patients with CFS. Within the CFSgroup now, we also observed a positive correlation between lengthof illness and the suggestibility index ( r= .4518; p= .023); suggest-ing that the longer these patients had had CFS, the more open theywere to suggestion.3.6. Lack of effort/simulationGlobally, the majority of controls and patients obtained goodscores, excluding a global lack of effort or simulation. At the indi-vidual level and considering the cut-off scores for each task: (1) nopatients obtained a score near or below chance on the Doors test;(2) only one patients with CFS and one with MDD obtained a resultunder the threshold on the ASTM (40/45); and (3) two patients withCFS and two with MDD obtained a consistency result under thethreshold on the WMT (70%).However, removing these four sub-jects from our database did not change the results for the differentcognitive tests presented earlier.3.7. Correlations between cognition and measures of depressionand subjective fatigueAre the cognitive impairments in patients with CFS associatedwith depressive symptomatology or subjective fatigue, and arethese potential associations the same as those present in patientswith MDD? To answer these questions, we evaluated correlationsbetween the main cognitive scores and BDI and GDS scores fordepression, and FSS scores for subjective fatigue ( Table 4 ). Ourresults clearly demonstrate that, for patients with CFS, surprisingly,there were no correlations between cognitive scores and subjectivefatigue, and only a few correlations between the working memorydimension (measured by PASAT and WMT) and depression, withno correlations at all for other cognitive dimensions. These resultscontrast with those of patients with MDD, for whom there werestrong correlations between most cognitive scores and not only thedepression dimension but also subjective fatigue. We also analyzedfor CFS patients whether scores on cognitive measures differedbetween the CFS patients with signiﬁcant depressive symptoms(GDS ≥11; BDI ≥14) and those CFS patients without the presenceof depressive symptoms (GDS < 11; BDI < 14). We did not observeany signiﬁcant difference between the two groups.4. DiscussionIn this study, we examined the performance of patients with CFSduring different cognitive tasks because there is still debate con-cerning the presence and interpretation of cognitive impairmentsin patients with CFS, with some studies showing cognitive impair-ment and others not. If there are cognitive deﬁcits in CFS patients,300 E.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295–302the question is then to know whether these are core features ofthe condition or an indirect consequence of other aspects of associ-ated comorbitities, one of the most important being depression. Inthis context, the cognitive performances of patients with CFS werecompared with those of healthy controls.Our results clearly demonstrate cognitive impairment inpatients with CFS and, more importantly, that it cannot beexplained by a lack of effort. Indeed, in terms of the subjects’involvement in the task, we observed very good global perfor-mances not only for patients with MDD but also for those with CFS.Also, importantly, the cognitive impairments remained signiﬁcantafter the few patients who showed a lack of effort ( n= 4 among atotal of 50 patients) were removed from our database.The patients with CFS differed from the control group in severalaspects. We observed that the patients with CFS were signiﬁ-cantly more anxious, more depressed, and more tired than thehealthy controls. The overall results of the cognitive tests showedthat, relative to healthy controls, cognition was weaker among thepatients with CFS. Analyses based on the group comparisons leadto the conclusion that the patients with CFS showed an impaired ormarkedly decreased ability to maintain attention and alertness. Thepatients with CFS had slower phasic alertness. They also showedimpairments in one working memory test (TEA) and a tendency toimpairments in another (PASAT) and in long-term memory (visualand verbal), compared with the controls.How can we interpret these cognitive impairments? Are theydirectly linked to the pathophysiological mechanism of CFS or dothey reﬂect an indirect consequence of the depressive symptomsoften observed in this condition? Two arguments suggest that thecognitive deﬁcits in CFS are core symptoms of the condition and arenot the consequence of the depression dimension of the disorder.First, when we compared the performances of patients with CFS andthose with MDD, there were several differences: the patients withCFS were signiﬁcantly less anxious and less depressed, but morefatigued than the patients with MDD. These results are in line withother papers. Using the BDI, Short et al. [25] and DeLuca et al. [44]reported that subjects with CFS were more depressed than con-trols. Cope et al. [3] and DeLuca et al. [10] , on the other hand, foundthat subjects with CFS were less depressed than depressed patients.Using the STAI, Riccio et al. [8]and Cope et al. [3]reported that therewere no differences between patients with CFS and controls. How-ever, DeLuca et al. [10] found that patients with CFS were moreanxious than controls but less anxious than depressed subjects,similar to the results of the present study. Finally, the literaturealso reports that subjects with CFS are more tired than controls[44,45] and more tired than depressed subjects [10] . For the cog-nitive tests, patients with CFS and those with MDD also differed inseveral aspects. There were three differences for the reaction timeand accuracy measures we used: the patients with CFS were slowerin the TEA working memory test and obtained a better accuracyscore on the PASAT test than the patients with MDD. It is also veryinteresting to note that patients with CFS were more impaired onthe long delay free recall of the WMT than patients with MDD. Thisindex is probably the most sensitive for the detection of memorydifﬁculties.The second argument for considering that cognitive deﬁcitsare core symptoms of CFS comes from the correlation analyses.Although, as expected, cognitive impairments in patients with MDDwere strongly associated with depression and subjective fatigue, inpatients with CFS we only observed: (1) a weak correlation betweenworking memory index and depression; (2) no correlation at allfor the other cognitive dimensions and depression; and (3) no cor-relation between cognitive measures and subjective fatigue. Ourresults are in line with those of several authors [3–5,13,15,22–25]who have shown that symptoms of depression do not correlate sig-niﬁcantly with a variety of neuropsychological measures, althoughother studies [6,7,11,17,21] have reported such a correlation. Asdiscussed by others [23] , the fact that, in this study, MDD and CFSpatients differed in several aspects is not surprising. From a neu-robiological point of view, there are also differences: hypoactivityof the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis is usually observed inCFS, in contrast to the hyperactivity of this axis in MDD [46–48] .Interestingly, in an atypical subtype of MDD (with hypersomnia,leaden paralysis, mood reactivity, interpersonal rejection sensitiv-ity), hypoactivity of this axis is also observed [46,47] .Our results show that globally the patients with CFS were nomore sensitive to suggestibility than the other two groups and, infact, were less suggestible than the patients with MDD. Our resultsdo not replicate the ﬁndings of DiClementi et al. [29] , who observedthat patients with CFS were more suggestible than controls on ameasure of general suggestibility (recall task of history) and on thehypnotic induction proﬁle (HIP) [30] . The HIP is a brief structuredtechnique that measures behavioural, perceptual, and cognitiveresponses to suggestions. Subjects are asked to perform an eyeroll and then, once their eyelids are closed, the hypnotic inductioninvolves suggestions by the examiner of ﬂoating and arm levita-tion. In that study, induction scores for the CFS group were higherthan those for controls. It is important here to specify that sug-gestibility is not synonymous with gullibility. Suggestibility refersto a type of information processing that is selective and distortedin that relevant information cannot be handled in a balanced fash-ion. According to DiClementi et al. [29] , “suggestible persons withCFS do experience the symptoms they report. However, a tendencyto focus on symptoms, perhaps to the exclusion of other infor-mation, may be related to CFS patients’ difﬁculties in processingcomplex cognitive information, and difﬁculties with divided atten-tion” (pp. 684–685). In line with this argument, it is important tonote that although, in our study, patients with CFS were not moresuggestible than the two other groups, there was a positive corre-lation between length of illness and the suggestibility index. Thismay mean that the longer the CFS illness, the more patients focuson their symptoms and if someone else focuses their attention ontheir symptoms, they will show a greater response to that sugges-tion and this process will impair the realization of the cognitivetask in which they are involved.As regards the impact of fatigue, there were no signiﬁcant dif-ferences among the three groups on the fatigue index. These resultsare in line with the observations of most other authors [5,6,25–27]who found no relationship between the level of fatigue in patientswith CFS and their performance on cognitive tests. However, Joyceet al. [13] did ﬁnd one relationship between these parameters.It is interesting to note that in another condition, the post-poliosyndrome, Ostlund et al. [28] also found no relationship betweengeneral fatigue and cognitive deﬁcits. However, it is important toremember that the fact that we did not observe a direct effectof fatigue on cognitive variables does not mean that, at the brainlevel, the mental fatigue induced by our task did not have differ-ent consequences on brain activity in our three study populations.In a functional neuroimaging study, Cook et al. [49] observed that,compared with normal controls, patients with CFS did not differin ﬁnger tapping or auditory monitoring tasks (PASAT), but exhib-ited signiﬁcantly greater activity in several cortical and subcorticalregions during the fatiguing cognitive task (PASAT). In particular,compared to controls, patients with CFS exhibited greater utiliza-tion of brain regions within the working memory system in orderto successfully complete the PASAT. These results, therefore, sug-gest an association between subjective feelings of mental fatigueand brain responses during a fatiguing cognition. Moreover, thefact that, in this study, the objective effect of fatigue on cognitionwas not larger than in the two other groups does not mean that thesubjective impression of fatigue would not be higher in patientswith CFS. Grafman et al. [5] investigated the relationship betweenE.L. Constant et al. / Clinical Neurology and Neurosurgery 113 (2011) 295–302 301the subjective memory complaints of patients with CFS and theirlevel of fatigue and found that there was evidence of a positiverelationship.Finally, the present study has methodological issues that need tobe addressed. First, the MDD group did not strictly match the othergroups in years of education. However, we believe that this cannotexplain the results observed in the cognitive tests. After adjustingfor years of education as covariates, we observed the same resultsin the different cognitive tests. Second, maximum age in the CFSgroup was 55, in the MDD group 68, and in the control group 64.Especially for the MDD and control group there were some olderpersons included. We know that aging has also a deteriorating effecton cognitive functioning although we do not think it would haveimpacted substantially the current outcomes. Third, the patientswith MDD were typically outpatients without atypical depressionor melancholic depression, so the results of the present study can-not be extended to all types of patients with MDD. Moreover, itcould have been their ﬁrst major depressive episode or a recur-rent one. Some may argue that patients with recurrent depressiveepisodes are more at risk of cognitive impairments. Fourth, we usedtwo self-administered questionnaires (BDI and GDS) to investigatedepression and not the Hamilton depression rating scale (HDRS)administered by a clinician. Some may argue that subjectivity ismore often reﬂected in the BDI scores than in the HDRS. We choseto use self-administered questionnaires because two psychologistsparticipated in the evaluation of the patients and we wanted toavoid interjudge variability. Moreover, in the GDS, physical symp-toms are excluded, which is important for the assessment of thedepressive dimension in patients with CFS. Fifth, although the con-trols were not included if they were taking psychotropic drugs, thiswas not the case for the patients with MDD or CFS, and psychotropicdrugs may inﬂuence cognition. Nevertheless, it is almost impossibleto conduct such a study in drug naive patients and we can argue thatour patients are at least highly representative of patients seen indaily practice. Finally, it would have been interesting to investigatethe suggestibility and fatigue dimensions with more than one cog-nitive test. It would have been interesting also to investigate othertypes of executive functions. Future research in this ﬁeld shouldalso compare cognition in subgroups with similar neurobiologicalﬁndings, for example, patients with atypical MDD or CFS.In conclusion, the present study conﬁrms the presence of objec-tive impairment in attention and memory in patients with CFSbut with good mobilization of effort and without exaggerated sug-gestibility.FundingNo ﬁnancial support was received for the work.Conﬂicts of interestThere are no conﬂicts of interest.References[1] Fukuda K, Straus SE, Hickie I, Sharpe MC, Dobbins JG, Komaroff A, Interna-tional Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Study Group.

These are risk factors for more a severe course of illness, and despite the considerable relapse risk of MDD, few interventions target the remitted phase, a high-risk period for developing new episodes. Online distribution of interventions could help close this gap. Computerized working memory training (CWMT) shows promising results, but findings are inconclusive regarding which symptoms improve following this intervention, and its long-term effects. This study reports results from a longitudinal open-label two-year follow-up pilot-study of self-reported cognitive residual symptoms following 25 sessions (40 min), five times a week of a digitally delivered CWMT intervention. Ten of 29 patients remitted from MDD completed two-year follow-up assessment. Significant large improvements in self-reported cognitive functioning on the behavior rating inventory of executive function-adult version appeared after two-years ( d = 0.98), but no significant improvements were found in rumination ( d < 0.308) measured by the ruminative responses scale. The former showed moderate non-significant associations to improvement in CWMT both post-intervention ( r = 0.575) and at two-year follow-up (r = 0.308). Strengths in the study included a comprehensive intervention and long follow-up time. Limitations were small sample and no control group. No significant differences between completers and drop-outs were found, however, attrition effects cannot be ruled out and demand characteristics could influence findings. Results suggested lasting improvements in self-reported cognitive functioning following online CWMT. Controlled studies with larger samples should replicate these promising preliminary findings.KEYWORDSremission, digital interventions, longitudinal study, relapse prevention intervention, computerized working memory training, self reported cognitive deficitsOPEN ACCESSEDITED BYManish Kumar Jha,  University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, United StatesREVIEWED BYFatma Ozlem Hokelekli,  University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, United StatesElayne Ahern,  University of Limerick, Ireland*CORRESPONDENCEEivind Haga Ronold    eivind.ronold@uib.noRECEIVED 10 February 2023ACCEPTED 16 May 2023PUBLISHED 05 June 2023CITATIONRonold EH, Myklebost SB and Hammar Å (2023) Improvement in self-reported cognitive functioning but not in rumination following online working memory training in a two-year follow-up study of remitted major depressive disorder.Front.

This trend has been enhanced by the COVID-19 pandemic (1), and the burden is in large part due to the high rates of relapse seen in MDD ( 2). New episodes are linked with persisting residual symptoms following affective remission including subthreshold depressive symptoms, fatigue, sleep problems, rumination, and cognitive deficits ( 3), contributing to relapse or recurrence and a more severe courses of illness ( 4). A large meta-analysis found small to large effects sizes for cognitive deficits in remitted MDD populations, measured objectively by neuropsychological tests, across most domains of cognitive functioning, excluding  auditory attention, general cognitive ability, autobiographical memory, in addition to inhibition unconstrained by speed ( 5). In addition, self-reported subjective cognitive difficulties (subjective deficits) are prevalent in acute states of MDD ( 6); and as residual cognitive symptoms following MDD ( 7, 8). Subjective deficits are of clinical relevance and are associated with lower quality of life and poorer functioning following MDD ( 9), and could contribute to the alarming rate of relapse seen in MDD ( 10, 11). Perhaps surprisingly, subjective deficits show small associations to cognitive deficits measured by objective experimental and clinical neuropsychological tests ( 5, 12) A meta-analysis investigating the correlation between subjective and objective measures of cognition found small significant associations between some measures, with most consistent effects between questionnaires measuring shifting and tests measuring shifting ( 13). Some studies suggest that subjective cognition show associations to symptoms of MDD rather than to neuropsychological tests ( 14, 15). In the research literature objective cognitive tests performed in a controlled environment is recommended as a measure of cognitive deficits in depression ( 16). Self-reported cognition could be considered complementary to the performance on objective cognitive tests and measure different aspects of ecologically important (dys)function ( 12, 17–19). Importantly, cognitive deficits are not fully remediated by traditional treatments ( 20, 21), and a few interventions target residual cognitive difficulties in the remitted phase of MDD, including medication, brain stimulation and cognitive remediation (22). Little is known, however, about the long-term effects of interventions targeting cognition following MDD, as was evident by a recent meta-analysis ( 23). There is also a lack of research reporting long-term outcomes in subjective cognitive deficits, with a few exceptions ( 24–28). Overall, the results from these studies reporting short- and long-term outcomes have been mixed Thus, exploring how new interventions influence subjective deficits over time is of importance.Another important residual cognitive symptom following MDD is rumination. Rumination is an emotion regulation strategy were one passively brood over self-related negative experiences and is hypothesized to be related to deficits in working memory (WM) for negative material, sometimes termed hot-cognition  (26, 29–31). Associations between objective cognitive tests and rumination are small, but significant associations have been established for WM ( 3), and subjective cognition ( 24). Rumination is a central risk factor following remission of mood symptoms (32), and predict relapse in remitted populations ( 4, 33, 34). Thus, deficits in cognition are suspected to be related to rumination, however, relationships to subjective deficits are unclear ( 24), and a recent review suggested that subjective deficits could cause rumination about not living up to one’s premorbid level, and thus increase relapse risk following MDD ( 19). Interventions improving cognition could thus reduce subjective deficits and rumination following MDD. Interventions like computerized working memory training (CWMT), could result in improvement of residual cognitive symptoms following depression ( 10, 23). CWMT has been shown to improve objective cognitive functions like executive functions and associations between rumination and WM for negative material ( 23, 35). Results are mixed regarding whether interventions like CWMT improves rumination however, with studies finding support for improvements in some residual symptoms like objective cognitive deficits, but not all, symptoms like subjective cognitive deficits, depressive symptoms, and some aspects of rumination ( 19, 36, 37). Even less is known about subjective deficits ( 19, 25, 26), and the lasting effects of interventions, with preliminary reports suggesting long term improvements in rumination and depressive symptoms, but not subjective deficits ( 25). Given the high relapse rate and incremental relapse risk in MDD, knowledge about the lasting effects of interventions targeting residual cognitive symptoms is vital.Supplying and accessing interventions targeting residual symptoms in remission from MDD can be challenging, as there are limited resources such as trained therapists in health care systems to deliver targeted treatment, particularly in remission ( 4). One promising approach is to deliver pro-cognitive interventions digitally as this could increase access, agency, and reduce costs ( 38). A strength within the research field is that many pro-cognitive interventions are already delivered online or are computerized ( 23). However, digital delivery might have implications for motivation and engagement ( 39). It has therefore been suggested that that sufficient guidance by therapists can increase motivation and engagement ( 40). In sum, given limited studies in this area, there is a need to further investigate the long-term effects of on cost effective interventions on clinically relevant residual cognitive symptom like subjective deficits and rumination.The current study investigated the long-term effects of a comprehensive digitally delivered CWMT intervention. If CWMT improves working memory (WM) control for negative material in hot-cognition, associated with rumination ( 35, 41), rumination would decline over time following CWMT. Ronold et al. ( 35) investigated CWMT effects on hot- and cold cognition, rumination, and depressive symptoms and found significantly improved effects on the two former, but not the latter. However, WM improvements could generalize to daily function, e.g., self-perceived cognitive function over time, and a study found associations between subjective deficits and later quality of life and psychosocial function ( 9), suggesting that long term development is important to investigate. Also improvements over time could reduce ruminative tendencies. It was thus hypothesized that CWMT would yield durable effects in self-reported cognitive function and rumination. The following research questions were investigated:-How does self-reported cognitive function (subjective deficits) and rumination develop two-year following CWMT?-Is CWMT improvement related to improvement in subjective deficits or rumination?Ronold et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163073Frontiers in Psychiatry 03 frontiersin.orgMethodsParticipants and procedureThis study is based on two-year data from an open pilot study investigating the effects of CWMT. Participants in the study were assessed pre, post, one- and two-years after CWMT.Recruitment, participant flowTwenty-nine remitted participants assessed by the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) ( 42) a score of ≤12, were included in the study initially [for more details see ( 35)]. Participants remained remitted at one and two-year follow up (MADRS score ≤ 12). One participant was missing from the completers group at 1 year follow-up. See Table 1  for demographical characteristics.CWMT interventionA commercial CWMT program, Cogmed ™ was used for cognitive training. The program consisted of several number-, letter-, and spatial span tasks with personalized, incremental difficulty. Participants worked approximately 40 min on different tasks each training day. The interventions were delivered digitally , online, were participants logged on through computer or laptop, lasted approximately 5 weeks, with roughly five days of training each week, and had weekly therapist guidance over telephone discussing progress and potential obstacles with the training, such as motivational issues. See Hammar et al. ( 10) for further description concerning the paradigm and follow-up.Ethics statementAll participants provided informed signed consent prior to participating in the respective studies. The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki declaration of Ethical Research regarding Ethical Principles for Medical Research Involving Human Subjects and the approved by the committee for ethical research in Western Norway (2014/1079). Participants were compensated through free access to the Cogmed ™ platform and received a gift card (approximately 40$) at two-year follow up.Outcome-measuresSubjective cognitive functionParticipants completed an inventory of self-report measure of cognitive difficulties in executive functions (behavior rating inventory of executive function-adult version; BRIEF-A) of which the 75 items global executive composite (GEC) was used to measure subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties. Raw scores were used to investigate changes, and high scores indicated poorer rating.RuminationParticipants completed a 22-item self-report assessment of rumination, the Ruminative Responses Scale (RRS) to assess tendency for rumination in response to sad mood.Statistical analyses and improvement scoresAll analyses were run in the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS; version 28). Attrition was investigated through one way ANOV A. Repeated measures ANOV A investigated changes in subjective cognitive function and rumination from pre- to post intervention, 1 and two-year follow up. Paired sampled t-tests was used as follow up tests. Percent improvement in CWMT was calculated by the formula highest score—starting score/starting score * 100. Improvement scores were calculated by subtracting pre scores from post (immediately after the intervention)- and two-year follow up scores, so positive values represented improved scores, and bivariate correlations between CWMT and residual symptom improvement was calculated (Pearson’s r). Effect sizes was described as small, medium, and large according to Cohen ( 43). Because of the small sample spaghetti plots showing the individual trajectories in BRIEF (see Figure 1 ) and RRS (see Figure 2 ) were used to illustrate development of subjectively reported cognitive function and rumination.ResultsThere were no significant differences between completers and drop-outs on any of the clinical or demographic variables with small effects (see Table  1 ), suggesting limited attrition effects.

Follow up tests showed a significantly changed BRIEF-A GEC score with large effect sizes from pre- ( M = 120.7, SD = 25.17) to two-year post-intervention ( M = 97.9, SD = 19.04), t (9) = 3.1, p = 0.013 d = 0.98. No other time point had significant improvements (see Table 1  for post-test and 1 year means). There were small and non-significant changes in rumination following the intervention at one- and two-year follow up. See Figures  1 , 2 for a graphical representation of individual changes in subjective cognition and rumination. Correlation analyses suggested medium correlations between subjective cognition and CWMT improvement and subjective cognitive function both immediate and two-year following intervention, however these did not reach statistical significance p > 0.05 (see Table 2 ).DiscussionLong term improvements on self-reported cognitive symptoms following a digitally delivered CWMT intervention were found. Although the results must be considered preliminary and uncertain due to the small sample size and lack of control group, findings support the use of digitally delivered CWMT to improve subjective deficits. In fact, the improvements in subjective cognition were even larger compared to preliminary findings from long term follow up of FIGURE 1Spaghetti plot change in subjective cognition score over 2 years ( n = 9).FIGURE 2Spaghetti plot of change in RRS score over 2 years ( n = 8).Ronold et al. 10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1163073Frontiers in Psychiatry 05 frontiersin.orgin-person interventions  cognitive training interventions ( 25). This could support better acceptability and feasibility of online tasks compared to other interventions ( 10, 26), especially for long term outcomes for subjective cognition.Rumination did not improve; thus, interventions targeting emotional information processing and hot cognition might be more optimal. Hot cognition involves cognitive control for emotional material ( 29), and could be more related to depressive symptoms than classical tasks of cognitive and executive functions ( 44). Alternatively, the small sample was underpowered to detect changes in rumination. Hammar et al. ( 10), for instance, reported that a subgroup improving from CWMT showed decreased rumination. Several studies have suggested that subgroups with different cognitive profiles could exist in MDD ( 45, 46), and finding moderators for personalization and optimalization of cognitive training effects are important for future research ( 47). There are theoretical and empirical connections between WM and rumination ( 31), with several authors targeting this modality by cognitive training with various success (36). Thus, personalizing interventions and examine subgroups to identify those who show- and do not show benefits could be important ( 47). Alternatively, or in addition, rumination might show more connections to hot-cognition than cold-cognition ( 29, 35, 41, 44), and targeting “hot cognition” could be more effective in reducing rumination and affective residual symptoms of depression ( 48). Thus, future studies should investigate the ability of digitally delivered interventions to target more broadly, including hot cognition and rumination, and investigate the mechanisms of cognitive training on emotion regulation ( 37). The weekly therapist contact might have influenced results. However, since improvements increased even 1 year after the intervention, this could probably not fully explain results. The moderate association between improvement in self-reported subjective cognitive difficulties and the training paradigm could suggest specific effects of WM training on self-reported cognitive functions in daily life and might thus represent an example of far transfer effects, or at least near transfer across domains. Findings could be relevant to relapse prevention because of this, however more methodological rigorous controlled studies should investigate this further.Strengths, limitations, and suggestions for future researchThis is the first study to report on the effects of digitally delivered cognitive enhancement interventions after two-years on residual cognitive symptoms. However, sample sizes were small-, dropout considerable, but comparable to other studies in the literature ( 23, 25). There were no differences on demographic or outcome variables between those completing the intervention and dropping out at pre intervention, however, attrition effects cannot be  ruled out, and some participants might have relapsed during training and follow up. The study was underpowered to detect small changes. Thus, acceptability could be a challenge in the current study. Previous studies, however, suggested that the current CWMT paradigm is both acceptable and feasible to use ( 10, 49). No objective neuropsychological assessments of cognitive functions were reported, limiting generalizability to cognitive deficits on behavioral tasks. However, subjectively experienced cognitive difficulties could be of clinical relevance in the remitted phase, as it could be associated with risk of depression relapse and poorer outcomes following MDD ( 19). Another limitation concerning outcome measures is not including a functional transfer measure of cognitive effects, which is recommended to investigate cognitive interventions generalizability ( 50). Sample- and demand characteristics could partly explain results, and future studies should investigate factors related to drop out, include more participants, and implement designs controlling for these variables. In addition, the increasing improvements in subjective cognition over time suggested that it might take time for effects to generalize, and thus longitudinal studies of cognitive remediation with longer follow up time might be feasible. However, due to the high drop-out, longitudinal studies with digital follow up assessment might be more optimal for acceptability following CWMT interventions, and future longitudinal studies should plan for this.ConclusionA group completing digitally delivered CWMT showed reduced levels of subjective cognitive deficits two-years following implementation. This shows significant promise in effective and available relapse prevention strategies. Thus, the digitally delivered working memory training shows promise in reducing subjective difficulties following MDD, and long-term effects of digitally delivered interventions could be comparable or supersede those seen in the limited research on interventions delivered in the clinic. However, given the methodological qualities of the current study, more controlled replication of results should be  done. There were no significant improvements in rumination, underscoring the importance of continuing to develop interventions targeting important residual symptoms like hot cognitive processes for optimal relapse prevention.Data availability statementThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be made available by the authors, without undue reservation.Ethics statementThe studies involving human participants were reviewed and approved by The committee for ethical research in Western Norway (2014/1079).

This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigatepotential differences in brain activation patterns in these conditions. In addition, the function of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA) axis was examined and compared between groups. Since there is a clear overrepresentation of women in thesediagnostic groups, and to ensure a more homogenous sample population, only women were included. To examine the neuralcorrelates of relevant cognitive processes in patients on sick leave .90 days due to work-related LTSL, recently diagnosedpatients with major depression Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV criteria,untreated), and healthy controls ( n¼10, each group), a 2-back working memory task and a visual long-term memory taskwere administered during fMRI scanning. HPA axis functioning was investigated using a diurnal curve of saliva cortisol and adexamethasone suppression test. Task performance was comparable among the three groups. Multivariate image analysisrevealed that both memory tasks engaged a similar brain network in all three groups, including the prefrontal and parietalcortex. During the 2-back task, LTSL patients had signiﬁcant frontal hypoactivation compared to controls and patients withdepression. Saliva cortisol measurements showed a ﬂattening of the diurnal rythmicity in LTSL patients compared to patientswith depression and healthy contols. Taken together, these ﬁndings indicate that work stress-related LTSL and majordepression are dissociable in terms of frontal activation and diurnal cortisol rhythmicity.Keywords: Cognition, fMRI, HPA axis, multivariate, prefrontal, stressIntroductionStress has emerged as an important factor inpsychiatric diagnoses. A dysregulation of stresssystems is implicated in major diagnostic categories,including mood and anxiety disorders, potentiallyreﬂecting psychological responses to work-relatedand personal stressors (McEwen 2003; Wahlberget al. 2009). Psychosocial factors and individualdifferences in coping style, emotional state, cognition,and appraisal have major impact on stress regulation(Berntson and Cacioppo 2000; Cacioppo 2002).The brain is the central mediator of physiologicaladjustments and behavioral responses to behavioralchallenges (McEwen 2006). Hormonal systems,notably the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal (HPA)axis as well as immune and metabolic systems areinvolved in the process of protecting the organismfrom and adapting to challenges. This process,referred to as allostasis, is an essential componentof maintaining homeostasis (McEwen 2003). Oneexample of allostasis is improved memory andimmune function with moderate increases in cortisol,which helps overcome challenging situations. Per-sistently high concentrations of cortisol may incontrast have adverse effects, including inhibitingthe formation of new neurons (neurogenesis) in thehippocampal region of the brain, possibly leading tocognitive deﬁcits and dysregulation of the HPA axisCorrespondence: A.

E-mail: agneta.sandstrom@jll.seStress , September 2012; 15(5): 503–513qInforma Healthcare USA, Inc.ISSN 1025-3890 print/ISSN 1607-8888 onlineDOI: 10.3109/10253890.2011.646347(Alderson and Novack 2002; Lupien et al. 2005). Theclose relationship between stress, allostatic load, andits impact on cognitive and endocrine function is wellestablished in psychiatric research today (Lupien et al.2007). Notably, speciﬁc alterations of HPA axis andcognitive function in different diagnostic categories ofpsychiatric diseases, such as major depression andpost traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are welldocumented (Lupien et al. 2009). In Sweden, morethan 50% of patients who were on long-term sick leave(LTSL) reported work-related stress as the main causeof disease (The Swedish National Social InsuranceBoard 2003).Research efforts in the ﬁeld of work-related stress arecomplicated by the lack of consensus about diagnosticcriteria. Depression is the category of use in the ﬁeld ofstress-related disorders, despite the fact that severalscientiﬁc papers indicate that depression and work-related stress do not share patterns of physiological andpsychological changes (Rydmark et al. 2006; Wahlberget al. 2009). The concept of burnout is initially adescription of the frustration and emotional detach-ment seen in social and health workers (Mason 1975;Maslach et al. 2001). Originally, the term was notmeant as a classiﬁcation of disease, but rather adescription of the process of exhaustion or adaptationto an overwhelming work situation. The SwedishNational Board of Health and Welfare recentlyrecommended a speciﬁc International statisticalclassiﬁcation of diseases and related health problems(ICD)-10 code (i.e. exhaustion syndrome F43.8) toclassify the closely related terms: clinical burnout, vitalexhaustion, and mental fatigue. As proposed byA ˚sbergand co-workers, burnout should not be considered anecessary or sufﬁcient condition for developing stress-related disease. Rather, it is a process or coping strategyto endure challenging situations at work that may leadto disease or exhaustion syndrome (Asberg et al. 2010).Since there is no international consensus on this issue,we have used the term work-related LTSL in this study.The symptoms of individuals on work-related LTSLoverlap with core symptoms of major depression(Wahlberg et al. 2009), which has prompted examin-ations of whether individuals on LTSL due to workstress and patients with major depression share HPAaxis pathophysiology (Rydmark et al. 2006). Thoughmajor depression has been associated with up-regulated reactivity of the HPA axis, patients withstress were found to exhibit a marked decrease in thereactivity of the HPA axis (Wahlberg et al. 2009). In thesame study, no support was obtained for a reduction inhippocampal volume, and cognitive impairment wasmore indicative of a disruption of the frontocorticalsystem rather than hippocampus dysfunction. We andothers have reported a similar pattern of neurocogni-tive alterations in stressed patients, with evidence offrontal cognitive deﬁcits (Sandstrom et al. 2005) andintact hippocampal volume (Sandstrom et al. 2011).In contrast, major depression has repeatedly beenassociated with lowered performance on hippocampal-dependent explicit/episodic memory tasks (Airaksinenet al. 2004) and reduced hippocampal volume(Videbech and Ravnkilde 2004).Collectively, these ﬁndings suggest differencesbetween major depression and chronic stress. Inparticular, individuals on LTSL due to work stresstend to exhibit frontal, rather than hippocampal,dysfunction. This view is in line with a notion of thestress–brain link that implicates many cortical andsubcortical regions other than the hippocampus,including the frontal cortex (Lupien and Lepage2001). Converging evidence indicates that not onlyaffective but also cognitive regions in the frontal lobesare dysfunctional in major depression (Steele et al.2007), and patients suffering from major depressionexhibit a pattern of cognitive dysfunction that extendsbeyond the domain of explicit/episodic memory toexecutive, frontal lobe-sensitive tasks (Stordal et al.2004; Dahlin et al. 2008). Furthermore, imagingstudies have suggested an increased activity in thesubgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) inpatients with depression, which is decreased bysuccessful treatment (Mayberg et al. 2003, 2005).Direct, within-study, comparisons of patients onLTSL due to work stress and patients with majordepression are critical for addressing the questions ofwhether these two categories reﬂect a shared or distinctpathophysiology. To date, such studies are rare and, tothe best of our knowledge, no prior study hascompared the functional brain responses of patientsfrom each category while engaged in memory tasks.The main objective of this study was to comparefunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)patterns and diurnal cortisol across three groups:(i) controls, (ii) acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression, and (iii) patients onLTSL due to work stress. During fMRI scanning,the participants alternated between a baseline task, ann-back working memory protocol known to reliablyelicit frontal activity (Dahlin et al. 2008), and thecontinuous visual memory task (CVMT) that hasbeen related to hippocampal activity (Yassa andStark 2008). First, we assessed similarities anddifferences in task-related fMRI activity among groupsusing a multivariate partial least squares (PLS)analysis (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004; Salami et al.2010), and then conducted univariate contrastsguided by the multivariate ﬁndings. We predictedgroup differences in engagement of prefrontal cortex,such that the stress group would under-recruit somefrontal regions. In addition, the diurnal rhythm ofsaliva cortisol and the cortisol response to thedexamethasone suppression test (DST) was investi-gated using saliva samples. We predicted thatdepressed patients would have higher cortisol levels,especially after dexamethasone (DEX).A. Sandstro ¨m et al. 504Methods and materialsSubjectsA total of 30 females participated in the study, 10 ineach group: work stress-related LTSL, unipolar majordepression, and healthy controls (Table I). Thedepressed patients were recruited from the psychiatricclinic at Norrland’s University Hospital. The stresspatients were recruited from the stress clinic at thesame hospital and were part of a larger study(Stenlund et al. 2009), which aimed at exploringwork-related long-term stress.Exclusion criteria were left-handedness or ambi-dextrousness, co-morbid psychiatric disorders, knownabuse of alcohol or drugs, endocrinological diseases,and neurological disorders. Subjects who were notmenstruating were also excluded. All participantswere native Swedish speakers. For the stress group,additional exclusion criteria were other diseases thatcould result in fatigue and/or stress-related symptoms,other diseases that cause future sick leave, otherdiseases or treatments that can interfere with activeparticipation, post-traumatic stress disorder, unem-ployment for more than 2 years prior to participation,speech and language difﬁculties, and a need forindividual therapy.The patients with depression and the controls wereall medication-naı ¨ve. In the work stress-related LTSLgroup, four patients were taking selective serotoninreuptake inhibitors. None of the stress patients weretaking tricyclic anti-depressants.The study was approved by the Ethics Committeefor Medical Research at Norrland’s UniversityHospital. All patients provided informed writtenconsent after having the procedure and objective ofthe study carefully explained to them and after theopportunity to ask questions. Subjects were not paidfor their participation.Clinical assessmentsThe depressed patients were assessed by a clinicallyexperienced psychologist (RS). The interviewsreviewed clinical and demographic information, andthe obtained data were used to conﬁrm or reject adiagnosis of unipolar major depressive disorderaccording to DSM-IV. Depression severity wasmeasured with the Montgomery–A ˚sberg depressionrating scale (MADRS) (Montgomery and Asberg1979; Svanborg and Asberg 1994). To be includedin the depression group, participants had to havea minimum score of 20, which reﬂects moderate tosevere depression. All of the depressed patients wereeither on sick leave or otherwise incapable to work dueto the severity of their symptoms.The stress patients were subjected to medicaland psychological examinations to conﬁrm thediagnosis of burnout (Schaufeli and EnzmannTable I.

LTSL, long-term sickleave; PSQ, perceived stress questionnaire; HAS, Hamilton anxiety score; MADRS, Montgomery–A ˚sberg depression rating scale.Brain activity in depression and stress 5051998). The patients were required to have been oncontinuous sick leave for burnout and stress-relateddisorder $25% of their working hours for at least 3months and to have an average score of $4.6 on theShirom Melamed burnout questionnaire (Kushnirand Melamed 1992; Melamed et al. 1992, 1999).All subjects were assessed with the MADRS,the Hamilton anxiety scale (HAS), the perceivedstress questionnaire (PSQ), and the burnout inventory(BI) on the day of the fMRI examination. Groupcharacteristics are presented in Table I.All self-rating scales and measurements of psychia-tric health used in this work are well known, validated,and reliable with excellent Cronbach’sa. MADRS is awidely used questionnaire to measure severity ofdepression. It is sensitive to change and thereforecommon in treatment studies. MADRS Cronbach’savaries between 0.80 and 0.90 (Montgomery andAsberg 1979). The HAS is considered a gold standardquestionnaire designed to assess anxiety symptomsregardless of diagnosis. It is sensitive to change and isfrequently used in clinical trials. Cronbach’sarangingbetween 0.77 and 0.99 has been reported in differentstudies (Hamilton 1959). PSQ is a self-assessment-based instrument for recording subjective perceivedstress (Cronbach’sa.0.90) (Levenstein et al. 1993).The BI is designed to assess components of theburnout syndrome: emotional exhaustion, deperso-nalization, and reduced personal accomplishment. Itsreported internal consistency/Cronbach’sarangesbetween 0.71 and 0.90.fMRI procedure . fMRI was used to assess brainresponses while the subjects performed two cognitivetasks: the n-back task and a visual long-term memorytask. Additionally, during the fMRI session, a low-demand baseline condition was modeled as a blockdesign to achieve similar sensorimotor activation asthe experimental tasks.The n-back task is a commonly used workingmemory task in fMRI studies. Subjects are presenteda series of stimuli and required to respond if thecurrent stimulus matches the stimulus displayednsteps earlier in the sequence. In our version, singlewords were displayed and the subjects were askedto indicate whether the displayed word was the sameas or different from the one displayed two wordsearlier (2-back).The visual long-term memory task consisted of a setof black and white abstract and non-verbal picturesdrawn from the CVMT (Larrabee et al. 1992). Thepictures were displayed one at a time and the subjectswere told to respond “yes” or “no” as to whether theyrecognized the picture from earlier presentations (i.e.a continuous recognition test).For both tasks, responses were given by pressingone of two buttons using the right or left index ﬁnger.In the baseline condition, the letters “xxxxx” weredisplayed on the computer screen either to the left orto the right side, and the subjects were told to press thebutton on the corresponding side. All stimuli (2-backwords, pictures, or letters) were displayed for 2.5 s,followed by a 0.5 s ﬁxation cross, and all blocksconsisted of 16 stimuli. The blocked task paradigmalternated between the baseline condition, the 2-backcondition, and the visual memory condition, and thiswas repeated in ﬁve sessions in a sequential order.Stimuli were presented in the same order to allsubjects during all sessions. Behavioral performancewas recorded for reaction times and responseaccuracy. Prior to fMRI scanning, subjects wereinstructed and underwent a trial version of the taskto ensure that they had understood the instructions.Data collection was performed using a 1.5 T PhilipsIntera scanner (Philips Medical Systems, theNetherlands). Functional T2 *-weighted images werecollected with a single-shot, gradient echo EPIsequence used for blood oxygen level-dependentimaging. The sequence had the following parameters:echo time 50 ms, repetition time 3000 ms, ﬂip angle908, ﬁeld of view 22 £22 cm, 64 £64 matrix, and slicethickness 3.9 mm. Thirty-three slices were acquiredevery 3.0 s. To eliminate signals arising fromprogressive saturation, ﬁve dummy scans wereperformed prior to image acquisition. Cushions andheadphones in the scanner were used to reduce headmovement, dampen scanner noise, and communicatewith the subjects. The stimuli were presented on asemi-transparent screen, which the subjects viewedthrough a tilted mirror attached to the head coil.Presentation and reaction times were handled by aPC running E-Prime 1.0 (Psychology Software Tools,PA, USA). Responses were collected with ﬁber opticresponse boxes, one in each hand (Lumitouch replysystem, Lightwave Medical Industries, Canada). Afterthe functional imaging, high-resolution T1- andT2-weighted structural images were acquired.Routine analyses . Subjects and controls were screenedin a fasting state at 08:00 h with routine venousblood sampling (5 ml) for each individual for lateranalyses of full blood count, liver and kidney functiontests, and thyroid hormones at the clinical chemistrylaboratory (University Hospital of Umea ˚, Sweden).Cortisol analyses . HPA axis tests were performed within10 days after cessation of a menstrual bleeding (i.e.during the follicular phase of the menstrual cycle).Study subjects were supplied with marked test tubeand instructed to spit in the tubes at 07:00, 11:00,16:00, 19:00, and 23:00 h. This was followed by a low-dose DST in which subjects ingested 0.25 mg DEX(DecadronwMSD) after the 23:00 h saliva sample.A. Sandstro ¨m et al. 506On the following morning, a saliva sample wascollected at 07:00 h for estimations of cortisol. Nofood, tobacco, or tooth brushing was allowed duringthe hour preceding sampling. Saliva cortisol wasanalyzed at the clinical chemistry laboratory,University Hospital of Umea ˚, by radioimmunoassayfrom Spectra, Orion Diagnostica, Finland, accordingto the manufacturer’s procedure for salivary cortisol.The coefﬁcient of variances (CVs) were ,12% forsaliva cortisol with an analytical detection limit of0.8 nmol/l, according to the manufacturer.Data and statistical analysesPre-processing of fMRI data .T h ef M R Ii m a g e swere sent to a PC and converted to Analyze format.The images were then pre-processed and analyzedusing SPM2 (Wellcome Department of CognitiveNeurology, UK) implemented in Matlab 7.1( M a t h w o r k s ,I n c . ,M A ,U S A ) .D u r i n gt h ep r e -processing steps, the images were corrected for slicetiming to adjust for acquisition time differencesbetween slices and subsequently realigned to the ﬁrstvolume to account for subjects movement. The imageswere then normalized to a standard anatomic spacedeﬁned by the MNI Atlas (SPM2) and ﬁnally spatiallysmoothed using an 8.0-mm full-width at half-maximum isotropic Gaussian ﬁlter kernel.Multivariate analysis of fMRI data . PLS reﬂects time-varying distributed patterns in the brain (as a functionof a task) without any assumption about howconditions collate to form a pattern and shape of thehemodynamic response function (HRF). A detaileddescription of how task PLS can be applied to fMRIdata can be found in earlier studies (Salami et al.2010). In short, a data matrix is constructed tofacilitate the operation of PLS on the entire data. Thismatrix is subjected to mean centering, followed bysingular value decomposition (SVD), to produceorthogonal latent variables (LVs). Each LV containsvoxel/design saliencies and brain scores. The latterreﬂects the strength of the contribution of each subjectto the LV, whereas the former reﬂects brain activationrelated to the experimental design. The signiﬁcance ofeach LV, indicating whether the overall pattern isdifferent from randomness, was assessed by apermutation test (McIntosh and Lobaugh 2004).Using PLS, it is feasible to extract the commonality aswell as the differences of brain activations acrossdifferent groups. Here, the critical interest was toinvestigate whether there were any group differencesin brain activity in relation to the three tasks.Behavioral PLS analyzes the relationship betweenthe behavioral measures (e.g. reaction times) and thefunctional brain activity of groups. The procedure isroughly the same as the one described above for taskPLS, but instead of mean centering, a correlationanalysis is conducted between the data and behavioralmeasures. As such behavioral saliencies were obtainedfrom SVD indicating task-dependent differences inthe brain–behavior correlation. A similar pattern ofscores depicting experimental differences in behaviorcan be obtained by conducting a correlation betweenthe brain scores and each behavioral measure. Theconﬁdence interval (CI) around a brain–behaviorcorrelation reveals its reliability.Univariate analysis of fMRI data . Each condition (2-back, visual long-term memory task, and baseline) wasmodeled as a ﬁxed response (boxcar) waveformconvolved with the HRF. Single-subject statisticalcontrasts (the 2-back task vs. baseline and the visualrecognition task vs. baseline) were generated (inSPM5) using a voxel-wise general linear model.Contrast images for each subject at each sessionwere taken into the second-level random effectanalysis (one-sample t-test) to identify regionsactivated across the groups for each model. Thereported activations were signiﬁcant at a voxel level ofp,0.001, uncorrected for multiple comparisons,with an extent of .5 contiguous voxels.Other data . Data are shown as mean ^1 standarddeviation or means ^SEM (standard error of mean),as indicated in the text. Non-parametric statistics(Kruskal–Wallis) with Bonferroni corrections wasused to test for group differences. Repeated measuresanalysis (ANOVA) for the 07:00 and 11:00 hassessments of saliva cortisol was used to assessputative group by time interactions. A pvalue,0.05was considered statistically signiﬁcant. SPSS v14.0was used for the univariate statistical analyses.ResultsBehavioral variablesThe average MADRS, PSQ, and burnout scoreswere highest in the depression group (Table I). Allmeasurements of psychological health in thedepression group were signiﬁcantly different fromthe control group as well as the work-related LTSLgroup. All depressed subjects and ﬁve LTSL subjectshad MADRS scores above the depression limit of20, whereas none of the controls had MADRSscores over 20. A signiﬁcant difference in the HASwas found between controls and the patient groups,but no signiﬁcant difference was found between thedepressed patients and individuals on LTSL.Patients with depression were signiﬁcantly youngerthan controls and individuals on LTSL. The PSQand MADRS scores also signiﬁcantly differed amongBrain activity in depression and stress 507groups (Table I). Burnout scores and HAS did notdiffer between patient groups but separated controlsfrom the two patient groups.Overall, all groups performed the memory tasks witha high level of accuracy during fMRI. The patientgroups, particularly the stress group, tended to haveslower reaction times than controls. This slowing wasparticularly marked for the n-back working memorytask, but did not reach statistical signiﬁcance (Table II).Brain imagingThe multivariate PLS analysis revealed two signi-ﬁcant patterns ( p,0.0001, Figure 1) that werehighly similar across the three groups, suggestinga high degree of similarity in the functional brainpatterns of patients and controls. However, somegroup differences were also observed.The ﬁrst LV accounted for 46% of the cross-blockcovariance and delineated a main effect of memorytask (i.e. n-back/CVMT vs. baseline; Figure 1). Theeffect was most pronounced for the visual CVMT,and occipital regions were found to contribute to theeffect, reﬂecting a stronger engagement of visual areasduring the processing of complex pictures comparedto strings of Xs. For controls and depressed patients,then-back task also signiﬁcantly contributed to theeffect, but this was not the case for the stress patients(the CI for the n-back task in the LTSL group crossedzero; Figure 1). Prefrontal regions, mainly in the righthemisphere, contributed to the effect expressed byLV1 (Figure 1, top row), thus indicating lesserinvolvement of prefrontal regions in the n-back forstress patients. This interpretation was examined inmore detail in the univariate analyses reported below.The second pattern (Figure 1, bottom row), whichaccounted for 29.5% of the cross-block covariance,mainly reﬂected a difference between the twocognitive tasks ( n-back vs. CVMT). During then-back task, a well-characterized frontoparietal net-work was activated (Figure 1, bottom row; red),whereas dorsal occipital and temporal polar regionswere differentially more engaged during CVMT, andto some degree during the baseline task (Figure 1,bottom row; blue). This effect was similarly expressedacross all three groups.The univariate SPM analyses involved groupcomparisons of n-back vs. baseline and CVMTvs. baseline. On the basis of the multivariate analysis,we expected weak or no group differences for CVMT,but some differences for n-back. This predictionwas conﬁrmed by lack of signiﬁcant group differencesfor CVMT along with a signiﬁcant group differenceforn-back. The latter difference was expressed inthe left frontal cortex during n-back when the controlsand depressed patients were combined into one groupand compared with the LTSL group (Figure 2A).A difference was also seen in the right dorsolateralprefrontal cortex, which was engaged by controls andpatients with major depression but not by the stresspatients (Figure 2B).Taken together, the fMRI results revealed pro-nounced similarities in activation patterns acrossthe groups, indicating largely preserved functionalnetworks in the patients. However, during the n-backtask, the LTSL subjects tended to under-recruitregions in the prefrontal cortex.Diurnal cortisol rhythmThe diurnal salivary cortisol concentration and DSTdid not reveal any overall differences between groups(Figure 3). However, the diurnal curve of the LTSLgroup had a tendency toward ﬂattening.

No such relationwas observed for the LTSL patients.Figure 1. Brain scores and singular images for two signiﬁcant LVs. Reliable voxels in the singular images are highlighted according to theirbootstrap ratio (BSR .3.29; p,0.001), which is the ratio of voxel saliencies (red and blue represent positive and negative saliencies,respectively) over estimated standard error. For LV1, the most reliable regions reﬂecting the main effect of memory tasks vs. baseline were leftmiddle occipital ( x,y,z:216,2103, 8; BSR ¼8.99; 509 voxels) and right cuneus ( x,y,z: 14,2101, 12; BSR ¼6.82; 489 voxels). For LV2,the most reliable regions in the positive direction, expressing the effect of 2-back vs. visual memory, were left inferior occipital ( x,y,z:216,294,26; BSR ¼8.48; 2652 voxels) and right middle frontal ( x,y,z: 34, 56, 14; BSR ¼8.42; 2076 voxels) cortex, whereas the most reliableregions in the negative direction, indicating the effect of visual memory vs. 2-back, were middle occipital cortex ( x,y,z: 30,286, 19;BSR¼214.05; 13,002 voxels). Note that the pattern as a whole is more important than one speciﬁc region alone.Brain activity in depression and stress 509DiscussionThe main objective of this study was to comparememory-related brain activity patterns and diurnalcortisol between acute unmedicated patients withunipolar major depression and patients on LTSL dueto work stress. Of main interest was to examinewhether LTSL patients under-recruited parts offrontal cortex during cognitive processing.The fMRI results showed pronounced similarities inactivation patterns across the groups, suggestinglargely intact functional networks. This was furthersubstantiated by intact cognitive performance.However, during the more demanding cognitive task(n-back), the LTSL subjects showed a reductionin prefrontal cortex activation. Speciﬁcally, a groupdifference was observed in the right dorsolateraland left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. In addition,response times during n-back correlated with brainactivity for controls and depressed patients but not forthe LTSL subjects, who tended to have a slowerresponse. This pattern of slowed response andreduced frontal activity in patients with stress disorderis consistent with previous ﬁndings that patients withstress exhibit reduced performance on cognitivelydemanding tasks that are assumed to reﬂect theintegrity of frontal lobe functioning (Rydmark et al.2006; Ohman et al. 2007; Sandstrom et al. 2011).In particular, the ﬁndings from the brain–cognitioncorrelation analysis are indicative of alterations offunctional working memory networks in LTSLpatients. Still, as this observation was found in amore exploratory analysis and was based on arelatively small group of patients, further generali-zations must await future replication.More generally, the present ﬁndings are in line withthe view that the frontal cortex may be as critical as thehippocampus when it comes to the regulation ofstress (Lupien et al. 2009). Notably, this is a dualrelationship, as the medial prefrontal cortex as well asthe hippocampus may be an important target forglucocorticoid actions (Herman et al. 2005). Indeed,a recent study has shown that chronic stress or chronicadministration of glucocorticoids produces dendriticremodeling in prefrontal pyramidal neurons (Martinand Wellman 2011).The diurnal saliva cortisol curve for the LTSLpatients showed a trend toward ﬂattening with highercortisol levels at 11:00 h, whereas controls anddepressed patients had similar diurnal patterns. Itremains to be determined if a blunted diurnal cortisolrhythm relates to changes in frontal cortex function.Previous work on the effect of glucocorticoids on010207 11 16 19 23 Post DexSaliva cortisol (mmol/l)Sampling times hoursMajor depression n=7Work stress related LTSL n=8Controls n=8Figure 3.

The singular images are overlaid on a standard MRItemplate.A. Sandstro ¨m et al. 510Figure 4. Behavioral pattern, singular image, and correlation overview for the only signiﬁcant behavioral PLS LV1 ( p,0.005). The top rowdemonstrates the behavioral LV that expressed a contrast, indicating task-dependent group differences in the brain–behavior correlation. Thesecond row shows the brain regions (overlaid on a standard MRI template) that negatively correlated with behavioral measures. The mostreliable regions in the positive and negative directions were right middle frontal ( x,y,z: 46,22, 56; BSR ¼9.59; 1531 voxels) and left fusiform(x,y,z:236,256,28; BSR ¼24.38; 11 voxels) cortex, respectively. The bottom row shows the correlation overview in scatter plots,reﬂecting the correlation between brain scores and reaction times for the 2-back task within LV1. The correlation was signiﬁcant ( r¼20.73;r¼20.80) for the ﬁrst two columns (control and depression groups), but was roughly zero for the third column (stress group).Brain activity in depression and stress 511memory function showed that they lead to deﬁcits incognitive tasks sensitive to frontal lobe dysfunction(working memory), but do not impact cognitivefunctions sensitive to hippocampal damage. Notably,repeated cortisol measurements across several days,including different weekdays, might provideadditional insight. Also, estimation of the cortisolawakening response be of interest, since severalstudies have suggested an altered awakening responsein different neuropsychiatric conditions (Kudielka andWust 2010). We did not ﬁnd any difference in DEXsuppression between depressed subjects and controls.This is of interest and suggests that short-termexposure to a depressive state may be less related tofailure of “shut-off” of the HPA axis. Indeed, the totallength of depression periods may be an importantpredictor of hippocampal dysfunction/volume whichmay relate to dysfunctional feedback function in theHPA axis. The number of participants in this studywas also insufﬁcient to reveal subgroups of depressedpatients with different HPA axis activity. It has alsobeen suggested that age of onset for depression mayinﬂuence hippocampal function/volume, but this is amatter of controversy (MacQueen and Frodl 2011).The healthy subjects and depressed patients showedmarked similarities in brain activation patterns,despite the fact that depressed subjects indicatedpoorer health in all measures of subjective well-being.Notably, the depressed group did not show theincreased sACC activity that has been reported earlierby Mayberg et al. (1999) and Mayberg (2003). Thesediscrepancies may be related to the fact that thedepressed patients in this study were recentlydiagnosed. Repeated episodes of major depression,as well as the severity of episodes, are known tocorrelate with structural and functional changes in thebrain, possibly reﬂecting hypersecretion of glucocor-ticoids (Sapolsky 2000). Taken together, the amountof time a person is sick might be a crucial factor fordeveloping changes in frontal lobe functioning.Importantly, we wanted to avoid treatment withanxiolytics and other substances known to inﬂuencecognitive function, thereby creating another possibleconfounder. An additional possible confounder is theyounger age of the depressed group vs. the LTSLgroup in our study. Finally, it is possible that the highscores in experienced stress and burnout in ourdepressed group raise the possibility that some of themare suffering from work-related stress.In summary, the present ﬁndings suggest adifference between patient categories, such thatlong-term stress relative to acute depression induceschanges in functional brain activity, notably in areaswithin the frontal cortex, as well as a ﬂattening of thediurnal cortisol curve. These ﬁndings need to bevalidated in future studies with larger samples, alsoincluding men. Future studies should also explorewhether functional and cognitive dysfunction, asshown in this study, is reversible by variousinterventions.AcknowledgmentsAS and RS contributed equally to this article.

The review establishes several correlational relationships in the context of substance use and disorder among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States. Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. Correlations are also observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma, all of which impact substance use patterns and disparities within these communities. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts.

The review establishes several correlational relationships in the context of substance use and disorder among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States. Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. However, surprisingly a negative correlation was observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts.

Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
Use exactly wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including capitalization choices.

START TEXT
The review establishes several correlational relationships in the context of substance use and disorder among American Indian and Alaska Native (AI/AN) populations in the United States. Notably, AI/AN status correlates with elevated rates of substance-related mortality, with alcohol-related deaths, chronic liver disease, and drug-related issues being notably higher. Additionally, AI/AN adolescents exhibit earlier initiation and higher rates of substance use, particularly among those living on reservations or who have dropped out of school, while AI/AN adults who drink tend to engage in heavy, episodic drinking patterns. Correlations are also observed between AI/AN communities and substance availability, trauma exposure, family and peer networks, and historical trauma, all of which impact substance use patterns and disparities within these communities. These correlational findings emphasize the multifaceted nature of substance use issues in AI/AN populations and highlight potential areas for targeted intervention and prevention efforts.

Given the text validate a series of relationships between variables that will be included in a json format below.
For example, if the json includes a relation like "Country's per capita income -> Country's literacy rate", and the text includes "We find a strong correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be direct.
If instead the text includes ""We find a strong inverse correlation p < .0001 between a country's per capita income and it's literacy rate" then the RelationshipClassification would be inverse.
The SupportText field of your output should include verbaitum text related to the relation between the two variables without paraphrasing.
The Reasoning field should be used to step by step reason from the text of the paper to try to come up with a good relationship classification and should focus on plainly stated results over implications.
The RelationshipClassification field can only be 'direct', 'inverse', 'not applicable', or 'uncorrelated'.
Direct means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another, and inverse means that an increase in one would cause a decrease in another.
Uncorrelated means there is no clear relationship between the two variables. Not applicable means the text does not suggest anything about the relationship between the two variables. 
Use exactly wording of outputs choices and input variable names, including capitalization choices. 

OUTPUT FORMATTING INSTRUCTIONS START
The output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.

As an example, for the schema {"properties": {"foo": {"title": "Foo", "description": "a list of strings", "type": "array", "items": {"type": "string"}}}, "required": ["foo"]}
the object {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {"properties": {"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is not well-formatted.

Here is the output schema:
```
{"properties": {"Relations": {"title": "Relations", "type": "array", "items": {"$ref": "#/definitions/SingleRelation"}}}, "required": ["Relations"], "definitions": {"SingleRelation": {"title": "SingleRelation", "type": "object", "properties": {"VariableOneName": {"title": "Variableonename", "type": "string"}, "VariableTwoName": {"title": "Variabletwoname", "type": "string"}, "SupportingText": {"title": "Supportingtext", "type": "string"}, "Reasoning": {"title": "Reasoning", "type": "string"}, "RelationshipClassification": {"title": "Relationshipclassification", "type": "string"}}, "required": ["VariableOneName", "VariableTwoName", "SupportingText", "Reasoning", "RelationshipClassification"]}}}
```
